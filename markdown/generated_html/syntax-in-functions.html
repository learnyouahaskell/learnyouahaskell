<p><img src="assets/images/syntax-in-functions/pattern.png"
class="right" width="162" height="250" alt="four!" /></p>
<p>This chapter will cover some of Haskell’s cool syntactic constructs
and we’ll start with pattern matching. Pattern matching consists of
specifying patterns to which some data should conform and then checking
to see if it does and deconstructing the data according to those
patterns.</p>
<p>When defining functions, you can define separate function bodies for
different patterns. This leads to really neat code that’s simple and
readable. You can pattern match on any data type — numbers, characters,
lists, tuples, etc. Let’s make a really trivial function that checks if
the number we supplied to it is a seven or not.</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>lucky :: (Integral a) =&gt; a -&gt; String
lucky 7 = &quot;LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN!&quot;
lucky x = &quot;Sorry, you&#39;re out of luck, pal!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>When you call <code>lucky</code>, the patterns will be checked from
top to bottom and when it conforms to a pattern, the corresponding
function body will be used. The only way a number can conform to the
first pattern here is if it is 7. If it’s not, it falls through to the
second pattern, which matches anything and binds it to <code>x</code>.
This function could have also been implemented by using an if statement.
But what if we wanted a function that says the numbers from 1 to 5 and
says <code>"Not between 1 and 5"</code> for any other number? Without
pattern matching, we’d have to make a pretty convoluted if then else
tree. However, with it:</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>sayMe :: (Integral a) =&gt; a -&gt; String
sayMe 1 = &quot;One!&quot;
sayMe 2 = &quot;Two!&quot;
sayMe 3 = &quot;Three!&quot;
sayMe 4 = &quot;Four!&quot;
sayMe 5 = &quot;Five!&quot;
sayMe x = &quot;Not between 1 and 5&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note that if we moved the last pattern (the catch-all one) to the
top, it would always say <code>"Not between 1 and 5"</code>, because it
would catch all the numbers and they wouldn’t have a chance to fall
through and be checked for any other patterns.</p>
<p>Remember the factorial function we implemented previously? We defined
the factorial of a number <code>n</code> as <code>product [1..n]</code>.
We can also define a factorial function <em>recursively</em>, the way it
is usually defined in mathematics. We start by saying that the factorial
of 0 is 1. Then we state that the factorial of any positive integer is
that integer multiplied by the factorial of its predecessor. Here’s how
that looks like translated in Haskell terms.</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>factorial :: (Integral a) =&gt; a -&gt; a
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)</code></pre>
<p>This is the first time we’ve defined a function recursively.
Recursion is important in Haskell and we’ll take a closer look at it
later. But in a nutshell, this is what happens if we try to get the
factorial of, say, 3. It tries to compute <code>3 * factorial 2</code>.
The factorial of 2 is <code>2 * factorial 1</code>, so for now we have
<code>3 * (2 * factorial 1)</code>. <code>factorial 1</code> is
<code>1 * factorial 0</code>, so we have
<code>3 * (2 * (1 * factorial 0))</code>. Now here comes the trick —
we’ve defined the factorial of 0 to be just 1 and because it encounters
that pattern before the catch-all one, it just returns 1. So the final
result is equivalent to <code>3 * (2 * (1 * 1))</code>. Had we written
the second pattern on top of the first one, it would catch all numbers,
including 0 and our calculation would never terminate. That’s why order
is important when specifying patterns and it’s always best to specify
the most specific ones first and then the more general ones later.</p>
<p>Pattern matching can also fail. If we define a function like
this:</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>charName :: Char -&gt; String
charName &#39;a&#39; = &quot;Albert&quot;
charName &#39;b&#39; = &quot;Broseph&quot;
charName &#39;c&#39; = &quot;Cecil&quot;</code></pre>
<p>and then try to call it with an input that we didn’t expect, this is
what happens:</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; charName &#39;a&#39;
&quot;Albert&quot;
ghci&gt; charName &#39;b&#39;
&quot;Broseph&quot;
ghci&gt; charName &#39;h&#39;
&quot;*** Exception: tut.hs:(53,0)-(55,21): Non-exhaustive patterns in function charName</code></pre>
<p>It complains that we have non-exhaustive patterns, and rightfully so.
When making patterns, we should always include a catch-all pattern so
that our program doesn’t crash if we get some unexpected input.</p>
<p>Pattern matching can also be used on tuples. What if we wanted to
make a function that takes two vectors in a 2D space (that are in the
form of pairs) and adds them together? To add together two vectors, we
add their x components separately and then their y components
separately. Here’s how we would have done it if we didn’t know about
pattern matching:</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>addVectors :: (Num a) =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a)
addVectors a b = (fst a + fst b, snd a + snd b)</code></pre>
<p>Well, that works, but there’s a better way to do it. Let’s modify the
function so that it uses pattern matching.</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>addVectors :: (Num a) =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a)
addVectors (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)</code></pre>
<p>There we go! Much better. Note that this is already a catch-all
pattern. The type of <code>addVectors</code> (in both cases) is
<code>addVectors :: (Num a) =&gt; (a, a) -&gt; (a, a) - &gt; (a, a)</code>,
so we are guaranteed to get two pairs as parameters.</p>
<p><code>fst</code> and <code>snd</code> extract the components of
pairs. But what about triples? Well, there are no provided functions
that do that but we can make our own.</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>first :: (a, b, c) -&gt; a
first (x, _, _) = x

second :: (a, b, c) -&gt; b
second (_, y, _) = y

third :: (a, b, c) -&gt; c
third (_, _, z) = z</code></pre>
<p>The <code>_</code> means the same thing as it does in list
comprehensions. It means that we really don’t care what that part is, so
we just write a <code>_</code>.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, you can also pattern match in list comprehensions.
Check this out:</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; let xs = [(1,3), (4,3), (2,4), (5,3), (5,6), (3,1)]
ghci&gt; [a+b | (a,b) &lt;- xs]
[4,7,6,8,11,4]</code></pre>
<p>Should a pattern match fail, it will just move on to the next
element.</p>
<p>Lists themselves can also be used in pattern matching. You can match
with the empty list <code>[]</code> or any pattern that involves
<code>:</code> and the empty list. But since <code>[1,2,3]</code> is
just syntactic sugar for <code>1:2:3:[]</code>, you can also use the
former pattern. A pattern like <code>x:xs</code> will bind the head of
the list to <code>x</code> and the rest of it to <code>xs</code>, even
if there’s only one element so <code>xs</code> ends up being an empty
list.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>x:xs</code> pattern is used a lot,
especially with recursive functions. But patterns that have
<code>:</code> in them only match against lists of length 1 or more.</p>
</div>
<p>If you want to bind, say, the first three elements to variables and
the rest of the list to another variable, you can use something like
<code>x:y:z:zs</code>. It will only match against lists that have three
elements or more.</p>
<p>Now that we know how to pattern match against list, let’s make our
own implementation of the <code>head</code> function.</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>head&#39; :: [a] -&gt; a
head&#39; [] = error &quot;Can&#39;t call head on an empty list, dummy!&quot;
head&#39; (x:_) = x</code></pre>
<p>Checking if it works:</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; head&#39; [4,5,6]
4
ghci&gt; head&#39; &quot;Hello&quot;
&#39;H&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Nice! Notice that if you want to bind to several variables (even if
one of them is just <code>_</code> and doesn’t actually bind at all), we
have to surround them in parentheses. Also notice the <code>error</code>
function that we used. It takes a string and generates a runtime error,
using that string as information about what kind of error occurred. It
causes the program to crash, so it’s not good to use it too much. But
calling <code>head</code> on an empty list doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Let’s make a trivial function that tells us some of the first
elements of the list in (in)convenient English form.</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>tell :: (Show a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; String
tell [] = &quot;The list is empty&quot;
tell (x:[]) = &quot;The list has one element: &quot; ++ show x
tell (x:y:[]) = &quot;The list has two elements: &quot; ++ show x ++ &quot; and &quot; ++ show y
tell (x:y:_) = &quot;This list is long. The first two elements are: &quot; ++ show x ++ &quot; and &quot; ++ show y</code></pre>
<p>This function is safe because it takes care of the empty list, a
singleton list, a list with two elements and a list with more than two
elements. Note that <code>(x:[])</code> and <code>(x:y:[])</code> could
be rewritten as <code>[x]</code> and <code>[x,y]</code> (because its
syntactic sugar, we don’t need the parentheses). We can’t rewrite
<code>(x:y:_)</code> with square brackets because it matches any list of
length 2 or more.</p>
<p>We already implemented our own <code>length</code> function using
list comprehension. Now we’ll do it by using pattern matching and a
little recursion:</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>length&#39; :: (Num b) =&gt; [a] -&gt; b
length&#39; [] = 0
length&#39; (_:xs) = 1 + length&#39; xs</code></pre>
<p>This is similar to the factorial function we wrote earlier. First we
defined the result of a known input — the empty list. This is also known
as the edge condition. Then in the second pattern we take the list apart
by splitting it into a head and a tail. We say that the length is equal
to 1 plus the length of the tail. We use <code>_</code> to match the
head because we don’t actually care what it is. Also note that we’ve
taken care of all possible patterns of a list. The first pattern matches
an empty list and the second one matches anything that isn’t an empty
list.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens if we call <code>length'</code> on
<code>"ham"</code>. First, it will check if it’s an empty list. Because
it isn’t, it falls through to the second pattern. It matches on the
second pattern and there it says that the length is
<code>1 + length' "am"</code>, because we broke it into a head and a
tail and discarded the head. O-kay. The <code>length'</code> of
<code>"am"</code> is, similarly, <code>1 + length' "m"</code>. So right
now we have <code>1 + (1 + length' "m")</code>. <code>length' "m"</code>
is <code>1 + length' ""</code> (could also be written as
<code>1 + length' []</code>). And we’ve defined <code>length' []</code>
to be <code>0</code>. So in the end we have
<code>1 + (1 + (1 + 0))</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s implement <code>sum</code>. We know that the sum of an empty
list is 0. We write that down as a pattern. And we also know that the
sum of a list is the head plus the sum of the rest of the list. So if we
write that down, we get:</p>
<pre class="haskell:nogutter:nocontrols:hs"><code>sum&#39; :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
sum&#39; [] = 0
sum&#39; (x:xs) = x + sum&#39; xs</code></pre>
<p>There’s also a thing called <em>as patterns</em>. Those are a handy
way of breaking something up according to a pattern and binding it to
names whilst still keeping a reference to the whole thing. You do that
by putting a name and an <code>@</code> in front of a pattern. For
instance, the pattern <code>xs@(x:y:ys)</code>. This pattern will match
exactly the same thing as <code>x:y:ys</code> but you can easily get the
whole list via <code>xs</code> instead of repeating yourself by typing
out <code>x:y:ys</code> in the function body again. Here’s a quick and
dirty example:</p>
<pre class="haskell:nogutter:nocontrols:hs"><code>capital :: String -&gt; String
capital &quot;&quot; = &quot;Empty string, whoops!&quot;
capital all@(x:xs) = &quot;The first letter of &quot; ++ all ++ &quot; is &quot; ++ [x]</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; capital &quot;Dracula&quot;
&quot;The first letter of Dracula is D&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Normally we use as patterns to avoid repeating ourselves when
matching against a bigger pattern when we have to use the whole thing
again in the function body.</p>
<p>One more thing — you can’t use <code>++</code> in pattern matches. If
you tried to pattern match against <code>(xs ++ ys)</code>, what would
be in the first and what would be in the second list? It doesn’t make
much sense. It would make sense to match stuff against
<code>(xs ++ [x,y,z])</code> or just <code>(xs ++ [x])</code>, but
because of the nature of lists, you can’t do that.</p>
<h2 id="guards-guards">Guards, guards!</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/syntax-in-functions/guards.png" class="left"
width="83" height="180" alt="guards" /></p>
<p>Whereas patterns are a way of making sure a value conforms to some
form and deconstructing it, guards are a way of testing whether some
property of a value (or several of them) are true or false. That sounds
a lot like an if statement and it’s very similar. The thing is that
guards are a lot more readable when you have several conditions and they
play really nicely with patterns.</p>
<p>Instead of explaining their syntax, let’s just dive in and make a
function using guards. We’re going to make a simple function that
responds differently depending on the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density">density</a> given. Density
(or specific mass) is a substance’s mass per unit of volume (here, grams
per liter). If a substance has a density of less than 1.2, it will float
in air, as 1.2g/L is the density of air. If it has more than 1000g/L
(the density of water), it will sink in water. Between are things (like
people, usually) that will neither float away nor sink in water. So
here’s the function (we won’t be calculating density right now, this
function just gets a density and responds)</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>densityTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; String
densityTell density
    | density &lt; 1.2 = &quot;Wow! You&#39;re going for a ride in the sky!&quot;
    | density &lt;= 1000.0 = &quot;Have fun swimming, but watch out for sharks!&quot;
    | otherwise   = &quot;If it&#39;s sink or swim, you&#39;re going to sink.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Guards are indicated by pipes that follow a function’s name and its
parameters. Usually, they’re indented a bit to the right and lined up. A
guard is basically a boolean expression. If it evaluates to
<code>True</code>, then the corresponding function body is used. If it
evaluates to <code>False</code>, checking drops through to the next
guard and so on. If we call this function with <code>24.3</code>, it
will first check if that’s smaller than or equal to <code>1.2</code>.
Because it isn’t, it falls through to the next guard. The check is
carried out with the second guard and because <code>24.3</code> is less
than <code>1000.0</code>, the second string is returned.</p>
<p>This is very reminiscent of a big if else tree in imperative
languages, only this is far better and more readable. While big if else
trees are usually frowned upon, sometimes a problem is defined in such a
discrete way that you can’t get around them. Guards are a very nice
alternative for this.</p>
<p>Many times, the last guard is <code>otherwise</code>.
<code>otherwise</code> is defined simply as
<code>otherwise = True</code> and catches everything. This is very
similar to patterns, only they check if the input satisfies a pattern
but guards check for boolean conditions. If all the guards of a function
evaluate to <code>False</code> (and we haven’t provided an
<code>otherwise</code> catch-all guard), evaluation falls through to the
next <strong>pattern</strong>. That’s how patterns and guards play
nicely together. If no suitable guards or patterns are found, an error
is thrown.</p>
<p>Of course we can use guards with functions that take as many
parameters as we want. Instead of having the user calculate the density
of the substance on their own before calling the function, let’s modify
this function so that it takes a mass (in grams) and volume (in
liters).</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>densityTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; String
densityTell mass volume
    | mass / volume &lt; 1.2 = &quot;Wow! You&#39;re going for a ride in the sky!&quot;
    | mass / volume &lt;= 1000.0 = &quot;Have fun swimming, but watch out for sharks!&quot;
    | otherwise   = &quot;If it&#39;s sink or swim, you&#39;re going to sink.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see if cat food will float …</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; densityTell 400 1
&quot;Have fun swimming, but watch out for sharks!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Looks like it will! At least until it dissolves into the pool…
Yuck!</p>
<p>Note that there’s no <code>=</code> right after the function name and
its parameters, before the first guard. Many newbies get syntax errors
because they sometimes put it there.</p>
<p>Another very simple example: let’s implement our own <code>max</code>
function. If you remember, it takes two things that can be compared and
returns the larger of them.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>max&#39; :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
max&#39; a b
    | a &gt; b     = a
    | otherwise = b</code></pre>
<p>Guards can also be written inline, although I’d advise against that
because it’s less readable, even for very short functions. But to
demonstrate, we could write <code>max'</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>max&#39; :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
max&#39; a b | a &gt; b = a | otherwise = b</code></pre>
<p>Ugh! Not very readable at all! Moving on: let’s implement our own
<code>compare</code> by using guards.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>myCompare :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering
a `myCompare` b
    | a &gt; b     = GT
    | a == b    = EQ
    | otherwise = LT</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; 3 `myCompare` 2
GT</code></pre>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not only can we call functions as infix with
backticks, we can also define them using backticks. Sometimes it’s
easier to read that way.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="where">Where!?</h2>
<p>In the previous section, we defined a density calculator function and
responder like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>densityTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; String
densityTell mass volume
    | mass / volume &lt; 1.2 = &quot;Wow! You&#39;re going for a ride in the sky!&quot;
    | mass / volume &lt;= 1000.0 = &quot;Have fun swimming, but watch out for sharks!&quot;
    | otherwise   = &quot;If it&#39;s sink or swim, you&#39;re going to sink.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we repeat ourselves here two times. We repeat ourselves
two times. Repeating yourself (two times) while programming is about as
desirable as getting kicked inna head. Since we repeat the same
expression twice, it would be ideal if we could calculate it once, bind
it to a name and then use that name instead of the expression. Well, we
can modify our function like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>densityTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; String
densityTell mass volume
    | density &lt; 1.2 = &quot;Wow! You&#39;re going for a ride in the sky!&quot;
    | density &lt;= 1000.0 = &quot;Have fun swimming, but watch out for sharks!&quot;
    | otherwise   = &quot;If it&#39;s sink or swim, you&#39;re going to sink.&quot;
    where density = mass / volume</code></pre>
<p>We put the keyword <code>where</code> after the guards (usually it’s
best to indent it as much as the pipes are indented) and then we define
several names or functions. These names are visible across the guards
and give us the advantage of not having to repeat ourselves. If we
decide that we want to calculate density a bit differently, we only have
to change it once. It also improves readability by giving names to
things and can make our programs faster since stuff like our
<code>density</code> variable here is calculated only once. We could go
a bit overboard and present our function like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>densityTell :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; String
densityTell mass volume
    | density &lt; air = &quot;Wow! You&#39;re going for a ride in the sky!&quot;
    | density &lt;= water = &quot;Have fun swimming, but watch out for sharks!&quot;
    | otherwise   = &quot;If it&#39;s sink or swim, you&#39;re going to sink.&quot;
    where density = mass / volume
          air = 1.2
          water = 1000.0</code></pre>
<p>The names we define in the where section of a function are only
visible to that function, so we don’t have to worry about them polluting
the namespace of other functions. Notice that all the names are aligned
at a single column. If we don’t align them nice and proper, Haskell gets
confused because then it doesn’t know they’re all part of the same
block.</p>
<p><em>where</em> bindings aren’t shared across function bodies of
different patterns. If you want several patterns of one function to
access some shared name, you have to define it globally.</p>
<p>You can also use where bindings to <strong>pattern match</strong>! We
could have rewritten the where section of our previous function as:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>...
    where density = mass / volume
          (air, water) = (1.2, 1000.0)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s make another fairly trivial function where we get a first and a
last name and give someone back their initials.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>initials :: String -&gt; String -&gt; String
initials firstname lastname = [f] ++ &quot;. &quot; ++ [l] ++ &quot;.&quot;
    where (f:_) = firstname
          (l:_) = lastname</code></pre>
<p>We could have done this pattern matching directly in the function’s
parameters (it would have been shorter and clearer actually) but this
just goes to show that it’s possible to do it in where bindings as
well.</p>
<p>Just like we’ve defined constants in where blocks, you can also
define functions. Staying true to our solids programming theme, let’s
make a function that takes a list of mass-volume pairs and returns a
list of densities.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>calcDensities :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; [(a, a)] -&gt; [a]
calcDensities xs = [density m v | (m, v) &lt;- xs]
    where density mass volume = mass / volume</code></pre>
<p>And that’s all there is to it! The reason we had to introduce
<code>density</code> as a function in this example is because we can’t
just calculate one density from the function’s parameters. We have to
examine the list passed to the function and there’s a different density
for every pair in there.</p>
<p><em>where</em> bindings can also be nested. It’s a common idiom to
make a function and define some helper function in its <em>where</em>
clause and then to give those functions helper functions as well, each
with its own <em>where</em> clause.</p>
<h2 id="let-it-be">Let it be</h2>
<p>Very similar to where bindings are let bindings. Where bindings are a
syntactic construct that let you bind to variables at the end of a
function and the whole function can see them, including all the guards.
Let bindings let you bind to variables anywhere and are expressions
themselves, but are very local, so they don’t span across guards. Just
like any construct in Haskell that is used to bind values to names, let
bindings can be used for pattern matching. Let’s see them in action!
This is how we could define a function that gives us a cylinder’s
surface area based on its height and radius:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>cylinder :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
cylinder r h =
    let sideArea = 2 * pi * r * h
        topArea = pi * r ^2
    in  sideArea + 2 * topArea</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/syntax-in-functions/letitbe.png"
class="right" width="215" height="240" alt="let it be" /></p>
<p>The form is <code>let &lt;bindings&gt; in &lt;expression&gt;</code>.
The names that you define in the <em>let</em> part are accessible to the
expression after the <em>in</em> part. As you can see, we could have
also defined this with a <em>where</em> binding. Notice that the names
are also aligned in a single column. So what’s the difference between
the two? For now it just seems that <em>let</em> puts the bindings first
and the expression that uses them later whereas <em>where</em> is the
other way around.</p>
<p>The difference is that <em>let</em> bindings are expressions
themselves. <em>where</em> bindings are just syntactic constructs.
Remember when we did the if statement and it was explained that an if
else statement is an expression and you can cram it in almost
anywhere?</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; [if 5 &gt; 3 then &quot;Woo&quot; else &quot;Boo&quot;, if &#39;a&#39; &gt; &#39;b&#39; then &quot;Foo&quot; else &quot;Bar&quot;]
[&quot;Woo&quot;, &quot;Bar&quot;]
ghci&gt; 4 * (if 10 &gt; 5 then 10 else 0) + 2
42</code></pre>
<p>You can also do that with let bindings.</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; 4 * (let a = 9 in a + 1) + 2
42</code></pre>
<p>They can also be used to introduce functions in a local scope:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; [let square x = x * x in (square 5, square 3, square 2)]
[(25,9,4)]</code></pre>
<p>If we want to bind to several variables inline, we obviously can’t
align them at columns. That’s why we can separate them with
semicolons.</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; (let a = 100; b = 200; c = 300 in a*b*c, let foo=&quot;Hey &quot;; bar = &quot;there!&quot; in foo ++ bar)
(6000000,&quot;Hey there!&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You don’t have to put a semicolon after the last binding but you can
if you want. Like we said before, you can pattern match with
<em>let</em> bindings. They’re very useful for quickly dismantling a
tuple into components and binding them to names and such.</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; (let (a,b,c) = (1,2,3) in a+b+c) * 100
600</code></pre>
<p>You can also put <em>let</em> bindings inside list comprehensions.
Let’s rewrite our previous example of calculating lists of mass-volume
pairs to use a <em>let</em> inside a list comprehension instead of
defining an auxiliary function with a <em>where</em>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>calcDensities :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; [(a, a)] -&gt; [a]
calcDensities xs = [density | (m, v) &lt;- xs, let density = m / v]</code></pre>
<p>We include a <em>let</em> inside a list comprehension much like we
would a predicate, only it doesn’t filter the list, it only binds to
names. The names defined in a <em>let</em> inside a list comprehension
are visible to the output function (the part before the <code>|</code>)
and all predicates and sections that come after of the binding. So we
could make our function return only the densities that will float in
air:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>calcDensities :: (RealFloat a) =&gt; [(a, a)] -&gt; [a]
calcDensities xs = [density | (m, v) &lt;- xs, let density = m / v, density &lt; 1.2]</code></pre>
<p>We can’t use the <code>density</code> name in the
<code>(m, v) &lt;- xs</code> part because it’s defined prior to the
<em>let</em> binding.</p>
<p>We omitted the <em>in</em> part of the <em>let</em> binding when we
used them in list comprehensions because the visibility of the names is
already predefined there. However, we could use a <em>let in</em>
binding in a predicate and the names defined would only be visible to
that predicate. The <em>in</em> part can also be omitted when defining
functions and constants directly in GHCi. If we do that, then the names
will be visible throughout the entire interactive session.</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; let zoot x y z = x * y + z
ghci&gt; zoot 3 9 2
29
ghci&gt; let boot x y z = x * y + z in boot 3 4 2
14
ghci&gt; boot
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0: Not in scope: `boot&#39;</code></pre>
<p>If <em>let</em> bindings are so cool, why not use them all the time
instead of <em>where</em> bindings, you ask? Well, since <em>let</em>
bindings are expressions and are fairly local in their scope, they can’t
be used across guards. Some people prefer <em>where</em> bindings
because the names come after the function they’re being used in. That
way, the function body is closer to its name and type declaration and to
some that’s more readable.</p>
<h2 id="case-expressions">Case expressions</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/syntax-in-functions/case.png" class="right"
width="185" height="164" alt="case" /></p>
<p>Many imperative languages (C, C++, Java, etc.) have case syntax and
if you’ve ever programmed in them, you probably know what it’s about.
It’s about taking a variable and then executing blocks of code for
specific values of that variable and then maybe including a catch-all
block of code in case the variable has some value for which we didn’t
set up a case.</p>
<p>Haskell takes that concept and one-ups it. Like the name implies,
case expressions are, well, expressions, much like if else expressions
and <em>let</em> bindings. Not only can we evaluate expressions based on
the possible cases of the value of a variable, we can also do pattern
matching. Hmmm, taking a variable, pattern matching it, evaluating
pieces of code based on its value, where have we heard this before? Oh
yeah, pattern matching on parameters in function definitions! Well,
that’s actually just syntactic sugar for case expressions. These two
pieces of code do the same thing and are interchangeable:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>head&#39; :: [a] -&gt; a
head&#39; [] = error &quot;No head for empty lists!&quot;
head&#39; (x:_) = x</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>head&#39; :: [a] -&gt; a
head&#39; xs = case xs of [] -&gt; error &quot;No head for empty lists!&quot;
                      (x:_) -&gt; x</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the syntax for case expressions is pretty simple:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>case expression of pattern -&gt; result
                   pattern -&gt; result
                   pattern -&gt; result
                   ...</code></pre>
<p><code>expression</code> is matched against the patterns. The pattern
matching action is the same as expected: the first pattern that matches
the expression is used. If it falls through the whole case expression
and no suitable pattern is found, a runtime error occurs.</p>
<p>Whereas pattern matching on function parameters can only be done when
defining functions, case expressions can be used pretty much anywhere.
For instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>describeList :: [a] -&gt; String
describeList xs = &quot;The list is &quot; ++ case xs of [] -&gt; &quot;empty.&quot;
                                               [x] -&gt; &quot;a singleton list.&quot;
                                               xs -&gt; &quot;a longer list.&quot;</code></pre>
<p>They are useful for pattern matching against something in the middle
of an expression. Because pattern matching in function definitions is
syntactic sugar for case expressions, we could have also defined this
like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>describeList :: [a] -&gt; String
describeList xs = &quot;The list is &quot; ++ what xs
    where what [] = &quot;empty.&quot;
          what [x] = &quot;a singleton list.&quot;
          what xs = &quot;a longer list.&quot;</code></pre>
