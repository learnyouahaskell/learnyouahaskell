<p>While Haskell’s purity comes with a whole bunch of benefits, it makes
us tackle some problems differently than we would in impure languages.
Because of referential transparency, one value is as good as another in
Haskell if it represents the same thing.</p>
<p>So if we have a tree full of fives (high-fives, maybe?) and we want
to change one of them into a six, we have to have some way of knowing
exactly which five in our tree we want to change. We have to know where
it is in our tree. In impure languages, we could just note where in our
memory the five is located and change that. But in Haskell, one five is
as good as another, so we can’t discriminate based on where in our
memory they are. We also can’t really <em>change</em> anything; when we
say that we change a tree, we actually mean that we take a tree and
return a new one that’s similar to the original tree, but slightly
different.</p>
<p>One thing we can do is to remember a path from the root of the tree
to the element that we want to change. We could say, take this tree, go
left, go right and then left again and change the element that’s there.
While this works, it can be inefficient. If we want to later change an
element that’s near the element that we previously changed, we have to
walk all the way from the root of the tree to our element again!</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll see how we can take some data structure and
focus on a part of it in a way that makes changing its elements easy and
walking around it efficient. Nice!</p>
<h2 id="taking-a-walk">Taking a walk</h2>
<p>Like we’ve learned in biology class, there are many different kinds
of trees, so let’s pick a seed that we will use to plant ours. Here it
is:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>So our tree is either empty or it’s a node that has an element and
two subtrees. Here’s a fine example of such a tree, which I give to you,
the reader, for free!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>freeTree :: Tree Char
freeTree =
    Node &#39;P&#39;
        (Node &#39;O&#39;
            (Node &#39;L&#39;
                (Node &#39;N&#39; Empty Empty)
                (Node &#39;T&#39; Empty Empty)
            )
            (Node &#39;Y&#39;
                (Node &#39;S&#39; Empty Empty)
                (Node &#39;A&#39; Empty Empty)
            )
        )
        (Node &#39;L&#39;
            (Node &#39;W&#39;
                (Node &#39;C&#39; Empty Empty)
                (Node &#39;R&#39; Empty Empty)
            )
            (Node &#39;A&#39;
                (Node &#39;A&#39; Empty Empty)
                (Node &#39;C&#39; Empty Empty)
            )
        )</code></pre>
<p>And here’s this tree represented graphically:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/zippers/pollywantsa.png" class="center"
width="780" height="504" alt="polly says her back hurts" /></p>
<p>Notice that <code>W</code> in the tree there? Say we want to change
it into a <code>P</code>. How would we go about doing that? Well, one
way would be to pattern match on our tree until we find the element
that’s located by first going right and then left and changing said
element. Here’s the code for this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>changeToP :: Tree Char -&gt; Tree Char
changeToP (Node x l (Node y (Node _ m n) r)) = Node x l (Node y (Node &#39;P&#39; m n) r)</code></pre>
<p>Yuck! Not only is this rather ugly, it’s also kind of confusing. What
happens here? Well, we pattern match on our tree and name its root
element <code>x</code> (that’s becomes the <code>'P'</code> in the root)
and its left subtree <code>l</code>. Instead of giving a name to its
right subtree, we further pattern match on it. We continue this pattern
matching until we reach the subtree whose root is our <code>'W'</code>.
Once we’ve done this, we rebuild the tree, only the subtree that
contained the <code>'W'</code> at its root now has a
<code>'P'</code>.</p>
<p>Is there a better way of doing this? How about we make our function
take a tree along with a list of directions. The directions will be
either <code>L</code> or <code>R</code>, representing left and right
respectively, and we’ll change the element that we arrive at if we
follow the supplied directions. Here it is:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Direction = L | R deriving (Show)
type Directions = [Direction]

changeToP :: Directions-&gt; Tree Char -&gt; Tree Char
changeToP (L:ds) (Node x l r) = Node x (changeToP ds l) r
changeToP (R:ds) (Node x l r) = Node x l (changeToP ds r)
changeToP [] (Node _ l r) = Node &#39;P&#39; l r</code></pre>
<p>If the first element in our list of directions is <code>L</code>, we
construct a new tree that’s like the old tree, only its left subtree has
an element changed to <code>'P'</code>. When we recursively call
<code>changeToP</code>, we give it only the tail of the list of
directions, because we already took a left. We do the same thing in the
case of an <code>R</code>. If the list of directions is empty, that
means that we’re at our destination, so we return a tree that’s like the
one supplied, only it has <code>'P'</code> as its root element.</p>
<p>To avoid printing out the whole tree, let’s make a function that
takes a list of directions and tells us what the element at the
destination is:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>elemAt :: Directions -&gt; Tree a -&gt; a
elemAt (L:ds) (Node _ l _) = elemAt ds l
elemAt (R:ds) (Node _ _ r) = elemAt ds r
elemAt [] (Node x _ _) = x</code></pre>
<p>This function is actually quite similar to <code>changeToP</code>,
only instead of remembering stuff along the way and reconstructing the
tree, it ignores everything except its destination. Here we change the
<code>'W'</code> to a <code>'P'</code> and see if the change in our new
tree sticks:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let newTree = changeToP [R,L] freeTree
ghci&gt; elemAt [R,L] newTree
&#39;P&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Nice, this seems to work. In these functions, the list of directions
acts as a sort of <em>focus</em>, because it pinpoints one exact subtree
from our tree. A direction list of <code>[R]</code> focuses on the
subtree that’s right of the root, for example. An empty direction list
focuses on the main tree itself.</p>
<p>While this technique may seem cool, it can be rather inefficient,
especially if we want to repeatedly change elements. Say we have a
really huge tree and a long direction list that points to some element
all the way at the bottom of the tree. We use the direction list to take
a walk along the tree and change an element at the bottom. If we want to
change another element that’s close to the element that we’ve just
changed, we have to start from the root of the tree and walk all the way
to the bottom again! What a drag.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll find a better way of focusing on a
subtree, one that allows us to efficiently switch focus to subtrees that
are nearby.</p>
<h2 id="a-trail-of-breadcrumbs">A trail of breadcrumbs</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/zippers/bread.png" class="right" width="321"
height="250" alt="whoop dee doo" /></p>
<p>Okay, so for focusing on a subtree, we want something better than
just a list of directions that we always follow from the root of our
tree. Would it help if we start at the root of the tree and move either
left or right one step at a time and sort of leave breadcrumbs? That is,
when we go left, we remember that we went left and when we go right, we
remember that we went right. Sure, we can try that.</p>
<p>To represent our breadcrumbs, we’ll also use a list of
<code>Direction</code> (which is either <code>L</code> or
<code>R</code>), only instead of calling it <code>Directions</code>,
we’ll call it <code>Breadcrumbs</code> , because our directions will now
be reversed since we’re leaving them as we go down our tree:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type Breadcrumbs = [Direction]</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a function that takes a tree and some breadcrumbs and moves to
the left subtree while adding <code>L</code> to the head of the list
that represents our breadcrumbs:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goLeft :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs)
goLeft (Node _ l _, bs) = (l, L:bs)</code></pre>
<p>We ignore the element at the root and the right subtree and just
return the left subtree along with the old breadcrumbs with
<code>L</code> as the head. Here’s a function to go right:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goRight :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs)
goRight (Node _ _ r, bs) = (r, R:bs)</code></pre>
<p>It works the same way. Let’s use these functions to take our
<code>freeTree</code> and go right and then left:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; goLeft (goRight (freeTree, []))
(Node &#39;W&#39; (Node &#39;C&#39; Empty Empty) (Node &#39;R&#39; Empty Empty),[L,R])</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/zippers/almostzipper.png" class="left"
width="399" height="224" alt="almostthere" /></p>
<p>Okay, so now we have a tree that has <code>'W'</code> in its root and
<code>'C'</code> in the root of its left subtree and <code>'R'</code> in
the root of its right subtree. The breadcrumbs are <code>[L,R]</code>,
because we first went right and then left.</p>
<p>To make walking along our tree clearer, we can use the
<code>-:</code> function that we defined like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>x -: f = f x</code></pre>
<p>Which allows us to apply functions to values by first writing the
value, then writing a <code>-:</code> and then the function. So instead
of <code>goRight (freeTree, [])</code>, we can write
<code>(freeTree, []) -: goRight</code>. Using this, we can rewrite the
above so that it’s more apparent that we’re first going right and then
left:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (freeTree, []) -: goRight -: goLeft
(Node &#39;W&#39; (Node &#39;C&#39; Empty Empty) (Node &#39;R&#39; Empty Empty),[L,R])</code></pre>
<h3 id="going-back-up">Going back up</h3>
<p>What if we now want to go back up in our tree? From our breadcrumbs
we know that the current tree is the left subtree of its parent and that
it is the right subtree of its parent, but that’s it. They don’t tell us
enough about the parent of the current subtree for us to be able to go
up in the tree. It would seem that apart from the direction that we
took, a single breadcrumb should also contain all other data that we
need to go back up. In this case, that’s the element in the parent tree
along with its right subtree.</p>
<p>In general, a single breadcrumb should contain all the data needed to
reconstruct the parent node. So it should have the information from all
the paths that we didn’t take and it should also know the direction that
we did take, but it must not contain the subtree that we’re currently
focusing on. That’s because we already have that subtree in the first
component of the tuple, so if we also had it in the breadcrumbs, we’d
have duplicate information.</p>
<p>Let’s modify our breadcrumbs so that they also contain information
about everything that we previously ignored when moving left and right.
Instead of <code>Direction</code>, we’ll make a new data type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Crumb a = LeftCrumb a (Tree a) | RightCrumb a (Tree a) deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>Now, instead of just <code>L</code>, we have a <code>LeftCrumb</code>
that also contains the element in the node that we moved from and the
right tree that we didn’t visit. Instead of <code>R</code>, we have
<code>RightCrumb</code>, which contains the element in the node that we
moved from and the left tree that we didn’t visit.</p>
<p>These breadcrumbs now contain all the data needed to recreate the
tree that we walked through. So instead of just being normal bread
crumbs, they’re now more like floppy disks that we leave as we go along,
because they contain a lot more information than just the direction that
we took.</p>
<p>In essence, every breadcrumb is now like a tree node with a hole in
it. When we move deeper into a tree, the breadcrumb carries all the
information that the node that we moved away from carried
<em>except</em> the subtree that we chose to focus on. It also has to
note where the hole is. In the case of a <code>LeftCrumb</code>, we know
that we moved left, so the subtree that’s missing is the left one.</p>
<p>Let’s also change our <code>Breadcrumbs</code> type synonym to
reflect this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type Breadcrumbs a = [Crumb a]</code></pre>
<p>Next up, we have to modify the <code>goLeft</code> and
<code>goRight</code> functions to store information about the paths that
we didn’t take in our breadcrumbs, instead of ignoring that information
like they did before. Here’s <code>goLeft</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goLeft :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a)
goLeft (Node x l r, bs) = (l, LeftCrumb x r:bs)</code></pre>
<p>You can see that it’s very similar to our previous
<code>goLeft</code>, only instead of just adding a <code>L</code> to the
head of our list of breadcrumbs, we add a <code>LeftCrumb</code> to
signify that we went left and we equip our <code>LeftCrumb</code> with
the element in the node that we moved from (that’s the <code>x</code>)
and the right subtree that we chose not to visit.</p>
<p>Note that this function assumes that the current tree that’s under
focus isn’t <code>Empty</code>. An empty tree doesn’t have any subtrees,
so if we try to go left from an empty tree, an error will occur because
the pattern match on <code>Node</code> won’t succeed and there’s no
pattern that takes care of <code>Empty</code>.</p>
<p><code>goRight</code> is similar:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goRight :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a)
goRight (Node x l r, bs) = (r, RightCrumb x l:bs)</code></pre>
<p>We were previously able to go left and right. What we’ve gotten now
is the ability to actually go back up by remembering stuff about the
parent nodes and the paths that we didn’t visit. Here’s the
<code>goUp</code> function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goUp :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a)
goUp (t, LeftCrumb x r:bs) = (Node x t r, bs)
goUp (t, RightCrumb x l:bs) = (Node x l t, bs)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/zippers/asstronaut.png" class="left"
width="511" height="433" alt="asstronaut" /></p>
<p>We’re focusing on the tree <code>t</code> and we check what the
latest <code>Crumb</code> is. If it’s a <code>LeftCrumb</code>, then we
construct a new tree where our tree <code>t</code> is the left subtree
and we use the information about the right subtree that we didn’t visit
and the element to fill out the rest of the <code>Node</code>. Because
we moved back so to speak and picked up the last breadcrumb to recreate
with it the parent tree, the new list of breadcrumbs doesn’t contain
it.</p>
<p>Note that this function causes an error if we’re already at the top
of a tree and we want to move up. Later on, we’ll use the
<code>Maybe</code> monad to represent possible failure when moving
focus.</p>
<p>With a pair of <code>Tree a</code> and <code>Breadcrumbs a</code>, we
have all the information to rebuild the whole tree and we also have a
focus on a subtree. This scheme also enables us to easily move up, left
and right. Such a pair that contains a focused part of a data structure
and its surroundings is called a zipper, because moving our focus up and
down the data structure resembles the operation of a zipper on a regular
pair of pants. So it’s cool to make a type synonym as such:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type Zipper a = (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a)</code></pre>
<p>I’d prefer naming the type synonym <code>Focus</code> because that
makes it clearer that we’re focusing on a part of a data structure, but
the term zipper is more widely used to describe such a setup, so we’ll
stick with <code>Zipper</code>.</p>
<h3 id="manipulating-trees-under-focus">Manipulating trees under
focus</h3>
<p>Now that we can move up and down, let’s make a function that modifies
the element in the root of the subtree that the zipper is focusing
on:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>modify :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
modify f (Node x l r, bs) = (Node (f x) l r, bs)
modify f (Empty, bs) = (Empty, bs)</code></pre>
<p>If we’re focusing on a node, we modify its root element with the
function <code>f</code>. If we’re focusing on an empty tree, we leave it
as it is. Now we can start off with a tree, move to anywhere we want and
modify an element, all while keeping focus on that element so that we
can easily move further up or down. An example:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let newFocus = modify (\_ -&gt; &#39;P&#39;) (goRight (goLeft (freeTree,[])))</code></pre>
<p>We go left, then right and then modify the root element by replacing
it with a <code>'P'</code>. This reads even better if we use
<code>-:</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let newFocus = (freeTree,[]) -: goLeft -: goRight -: modify (\_ -&gt; &#39;P&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>We can then move up if we want and replace an element with a
mysterious <code>'X'</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let newFocus2 = modify (\_ -&gt; &#39;X&#39;) (goUp newFocus)</code></pre>
<p>Or if we wrote it with <code>-:</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let newFocus2 = newFocus -: goUp -: modify (\_ -&gt; &#39;X&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Moving up is easy because the breadcrumbs that we leave form the part
of the data structure that we’re not focusing on, but it’s inverted,
sort of like turning a sock inside out. That’s why when we want to move
up, we don’t have to start from the root and make our way down, but we
just take the top of our inverted tree, thereby uninverting a part of it
and adding it to our focus.</p>
<p>Each node has two subtrees, even if those subtrees are empty trees.
So if we’re focusing on an empty subtree, one thing we can do is to
replace it with a non-empty subtree, thus attaching a tree to a leaf
node. The code for this is simple:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>attach :: Tree a -&gt; Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
attach t (_, bs) = (t, bs)</code></pre>
<p>We take a tree and a zipper and return a new zipper that has its
focus replaced with the supplied tree. Not only can we extend trees this
way by replacing empty subtrees with new trees, we can also replace
whole existing subtrees. Let’s attach a tree to the far left of our
<code>freeTree</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let farLeft = (freeTree,[]) -: goLeft -: goLeft -: goLeft -: goLeft
ghci&gt; let newFocus = farLeft -: attach (Node &#39;Z&#39; Empty Empty)</code></pre>
<p><code>newFocus</code> is now focused on the tree that we just
attached and the rest of the tree lies inverted in the breadcrumbs. If
we were to use <code>goUp</code> to walk all the way to the top of the
tree, it would be the same tree as <code>freeTree</code> but with an
additional <code>'Z'</code> on its far left.</p>
<h3
id="im-going-straight-to-the-top-oh-yeah-up-where-the-air-is-fresh-and-clean">I’m
going straight to the top, oh yeah, up where the air is fresh and
clean!</h3>
<p>Making a function that walks all the way to the top of the tree,
regardless of what we’re focusing on, is really easy. Here it is:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>topMost :: Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
topMost (t,[]) = (t,[])
topMost z = topMost (goUp z)</code></pre>
<p>If our trail of beefed up breadcrumbs is empty, this means that we’re
already at the root of our tree, so we just return the current focus.
Otherwise, we go up to get the focus of the parent node and then
recursively apply <code>topMost</code> to that. So now we can walk
around our tree, going left and right and up, applying
<code>modify</code> and <code>attach</code> as we go along and then when
we’re done with our modifications, we use <code>topMost</code> to focus
on the root of our tree and see the changes that we’ve done in proper
perspective.</p>
<h2 id="focusing-on-lists">Focusing on lists</h2>
<p>Zippers can be used with pretty much any data structure, so it’s no
surprise that they can be used to focus on sub-lists of lists. After
all, lists are pretty much like trees, only where a node in a tree has
an element (or not) and several subtrees, a node in a list has an
element and only a single sub-list. When we <a
href="making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses.html#recursive-data-structures">implemented
our own lists</a>, we defined our data type like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/zippers/picard.png" class="right" width="355"
height="380" alt="the best damn thing" /></p>
<p>Contrast this with our definition of our binary tree and it’s easy to
see how lists can be viewed as trees where each node has only one
subtree.</p>
<p>A list like <code>[1,2,3]</code> can be written as
<code>1:2:3:[]</code>. It consists of the head of the list, which is
<code>1</code> and then the list’s tail, which is <code>2:3:[]</code>.
In turn, <code>2:3:[]</code> also has a head, which is <code>2</code>
and a tail, which is <code>3:[]</code>. With <code>3:[]</code>, the
<code>3</code> is the head and the tail is the empty list
<code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s make a zipper for lists. To change the focus on sub-lists of a
list, we move either forward or back (whereas with trees we moved either
up or left or right). The focused part will be a subtree and along with
that we’ll leave breadcrumbs as we move forward. Now what would a single
breadcrumb for a list consist of? When we were dealing with binary
trees, we said that a breadcrumb has to hold the element in the root of
the parent node along with all the subtrees that we didn’t choose. It
also had to remember if we went left or right. So, it had to have all
the information that a node has except for the subtree that we chose to
focus on.</p>
<p>Lists are simpler than trees, so we don’t have to remember if we went
left or right, because there’s only one way to go deeper into a list.
Because there’s only one subtree to each node, we don’t have to remember
the paths that we didn’t take either. It seems that all we have to
remember is the previous element. If we have a list like
<code>[3,4,5]</code> and we know that the previous element was
<code>2</code>, we can go back by just putting that element at the head
of our list, getting <code>[2,3,4,5]</code>.</p>
<p>Because a single breadcrumb here is just the element, we don’t really
have to put it inside a data type, like we did when we made the
<code>Crumb</code> data type for tree zippers:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type ListZipper a = ([a],[a])</code></pre>
<p>The first list represents the list that we’re focusing on and the
second list is the list of breadcrumbs. Let’s make functions that go
forward and back into lists:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goForward :: ListZipper a -&gt; ListZipper a
goForward (x:xs, bs) = (xs, x:bs)

goBack :: ListZipper a -&gt; ListZipper a
goBack (xs, b:bs) = (b:xs, bs)</code></pre>
<p>When we’re going forward, we focus on the tail of the current list
and leave the head element as a breadcrumb. When we’re moving backwards,
we take the latest breadcrumb and put it at the beginning of the
list.</p>
<p>Here are these two functions in action:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let xs = [1,2,3,4]
ghci&gt; goForward (xs,[])
([2,3,4],[1])
ghci&gt; goForward ([2,3,4],[1])
([3,4],[2,1])
ghci&gt; goForward ([3,4],[2,1])
([4],[3,2,1])
ghci&gt; goBack ([4],[3,2,1])
([3,4],[2,1])</code></pre>
<p>We see that the breadcrumbs in the case of lists are nothing more but
a reversed part of our list. The element that we move away from always
goes into the head of the breadcrumbs, so it’s easy to move back by just
taking that element from the head of the breadcrumbs and making it the
head of our focus.</p>
<p>This also makes it easier to see why we call this a zipper, because
this really looks like the slider of a zipper moving up and down.</p>
<p>If you were making a text editor, you could use a list of strings to
represent the lines of text that are currently opened and you could then
use a zipper so that you know which line the cursor is currently focused
on. By using a zipper, it would also make it easier to insert new lines
anywhere in the text or delete existing ones.</p>
<h2 id="a-very-simple-file-system">A very simple file system</h2>
<p>Now that we know how zippers work, let’s use trees to represent a
very simple file system and then make a zipper for that file system,
which will allow us to move between folders, just like we usually do
when jumping around our file system.</p>
<p>If we take a simplistic view of the average hierarchical file system,
we see that it’s mostly made up of files and folders. Files are units of
data and come with a name, whereas folders are used to organize those
files and can contain files or other folders. So let’s say that an item
in a file system is either a file, which comes with a name and some
data, or a folder, which has a name and then a bunch of items that are
either files or folders themselves. Here’s a data type for this and some
type synonyms so we know what’s what:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type Name = String
type Data = String
data FSItem = File Name Data | Folder Name [FSItem] deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>A file comes with two strings, which represent its name and the data
it holds. A folder comes with a string that is its name and a list of
items. If that list is empty, then we have an empty folder.</p>
<p>Here’s a folder with some files and sub-folders:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>myDisk :: FSItem
myDisk =
    Folder &quot;root&quot;
        [ File &quot;goat_yelling_like_man.wmv&quot; &quot;baaaaaa&quot;
        , File &quot;pope_time.avi&quot; &quot;god bless&quot;
        , Folder &quot;pics&quot;
            [ File &quot;ape_throwing_up.jpg&quot; &quot;bleargh&quot;
            , File &quot;watermelon_smash.gif&quot; &quot;smash!!&quot;
            , File &quot;skull_man(scary).bmp&quot; &quot;Yikes!&quot;
            ]
        , File &quot;dijon_poupon.doc&quot; &quot;best mustard&quot;
        , Folder &quot;programs&quot;
            [ File &quot;fartwizard.exe&quot; &quot;10gotofart&quot;
            , File &quot;owl_bandit.dmg&quot; &quot;mov eax, h00t&quot;
            , File &quot;not_a_virus.exe&quot; &quot;really not a virus&quot;
            , Folder &quot;source code&quot;
                [ File &quot;best_hs_prog.hs&quot; &quot;main = print (fix error)&quot;
                , File &quot;random.hs&quot; &quot;main = print 4&quot;
                ]
            ]
        ]</code></pre>
<p>That’s actually what my disk contains right now.</p>
<h3 id="a-zipper-for-our-file-system">A zipper for our file system</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/zippers/spongedisk.png" class="right"
width="243" height="271" alt="spongedisk" /></p>
<p>Now that we have a file system, all we need is a zipper so we can zip
and zoom around it and add, modify and remove files as well as folders.
Like with binary trees and lists, we’re going to be leaving breadcrumbs
that contain info about all the stuff that we chose not to visit. Like
we said, a single breadcrumb should be kind of like a node, only it
should contain everything except the subtree that we’re currently
focusing on. It should also note where the hole is so that once we move
back up, we can plug our previous focus into the hole.</p>
<p>In this case, a breadcrumb should be like a folder, only it should be
missing the folder that we currently chose. Why not like a file, you
ask? Well, because once we’re focusing on a file, we can’t move deeper
into the file system, so it doesn’t make sense to leave a breadcrumb
that says that we came from a file. A file is sort of like an empty
tree.</p>
<p>If we’re focusing on the folder <code>"root"</code> and we then focus
on the file <code>"dijon_poupon.doc"</code>, what should the breadcrumb
that we leave look like? Well, it should contain the name of its parent
folder along with the items that come before the file that we’re
focusing on and the items that come after it. So all we need is a
<code>Name</code> and two lists of items. By keeping separate lists for
the items that come before the item that we’re focusing and for the
items that come after it, we know exactly where to place it once we move
back up. So this way, we know where the hole is.</p>
<p>Here’s our breadcrumb type for the file system:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data FSCrumb = FSCrumb Name [FSItem] [FSItem] deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>And here’s a type synonym for our zipper:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type FSZipper = (FSItem, [FSCrumb])</code></pre>
<p>Going back up in the hierarchy is very simple. We just take the
latest breadcrumb and assemble a new focus from the current focus and
breadcrumb. Like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>fsUp :: FSZipper -&gt; FSZipper
fsUp (item, FSCrumb name ls rs:bs) = (Folder name (ls ++ [item] ++ rs), bs)</code></pre>
<p>Because our breadcrumb knew what the parent folder’s name was, as
well as the items that came before our focused item in the folder
(that’s <code>ls</code>) and the ones that came after (that’s
<code>rs</code>), moving up was easy.</p>
<p>How about going deeper into the file system? If we’re in the
<code>"root"</code> and we want to focus on
<code>"dijon_poupon.doc"</code>, the breadcrumb that we leave is going
to include the name <code>"root"</code> along with the items that
precede <code>"dijon_poupon.doc"</code> and the ones that come after
it.</p>
<p>Here’s a function that, given a name, focuses on a file of folder
that’s located in the current focused folder:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.List (break)

fsTo :: Name -&gt; FSZipper -&gt; FSZipper
fsTo name (Folder folderName items, bs) =
    let (ls, item:rs) = break (nameIs name) items
    in  (item, FSCrumb folderName ls rs:bs)

nameIs :: Name -&gt; FSItem -&gt; Bool
nameIs name (Folder folderName _) = name == folderName
nameIs name (File fileName _) = name == fileName</code></pre>
<p><code>fsTo</code> takes a <code>Name</code> and a
<code>FSZipper</code> and returns a new <code>FSZipper</code> that
focuses on the file with the given name. That file has to be in the
current focused folder. This function doesn’t search all over the place,
it just looks at the current folder.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/zippers/cool.png" class="left" width="205"
height="197" alt="wow cool great" /></p>
<p>First we use <code>break</code> to break the list of items in a
folder into those that precede the file that we’re searching for and
those that come after it. If you remember, <code>break</code> takes a
predicate and a list and returns a pair of lists. The first list in the
pair holds items for which the predicate returns <code>False</code>.
Then, once the predicate returns <code>True</code> for an item, it
places that item and the rest of the list in the second item of the
pair. We made an auxilliary function called <code>nameIs</code> that
takes a name and a file system item and returns <code>True</code> if the
names match.</p>
<p>So now, <code>ls</code> is a list that contains the items that
precede the item that we’re searching for, <code>item</code> is that
very item and <code>rs</code> is the list of items that come after it in
its folder. Now that we have this, we just present the item that we got
from <code>break</code> as the focus and build a breadcrumb that has all
the data it needs.</p>
<p>Note that if the name we’re looking for isn’t in the folder, the
pattern <code>item:rs</code> will try to match on an empty list and
we’ll get an error. Also, if our current focus isn’t a folder at all but
a file, we get an error as well and the program crashes.</p>
<p>Now we can move up and down our file system. Let’s start at the root
and walk to the file <code>"skull_man(scary).bmp"</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let newFocus = (myDisk,[]) -: fsTo &quot;pics&quot; -: fsTo &quot;skull_man(scary).bmp&quot;</code></pre>
<p><code>newFocus</code> is now a zipper that’s focused on the
<code>"skull_man(scary).bmp"</code> file. Let’s get the first component
of the zipper (the focus itself) and see if that’s really true:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fst newFocus
File &quot;skull_man(scary).bmp&quot; &quot;Yikes!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Let’s move up and then focus on its neighboring file
<code>"watermelon_smash.gif"</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let newFocus2 = newFocus -: fsUp -: fsTo &quot;watermelon_smash.gif&quot;
ghci&gt; fst newFocus2
File &quot;watermelon_smash.gif&quot; &quot;smash!!&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="manipulating-our-file-system">Manipulating our file system</h3>
<p>Now that we know how to navigate our file system, manipulating it is
easy. Here’s a function that renames the currently focused file or
folder:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>fsRename :: Name -&gt; FSZipper -&gt; FSZipper
fsRename newName (Folder name items, bs) = (Folder newName items, bs)
fsRename newName (File name dat, bs) = (File newName dat, bs)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can rename our <code>"pics"</code> folder to
<code>"cspi"</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let newFocus = (myDisk,[]) -: fsTo &quot;pics&quot; -: fsRename &quot;cspi&quot; -: fsUp</code></pre>
<p>We descended to the <code>"pics"</code> folder, renamed it and then
moved back up.</p>
<p>How about a function that makes a new item in the current folder?
Behold:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>fsNewFile :: FSItem -&gt; FSZipper -&gt; FSZipper
fsNewFile item (Folder folderName items, bs) =
    (Folder folderName (item:items), bs)</code></pre>
<p>Easy as pie. Note that this would crash if we tried to add an item
but weren’t focusing on a folder, but were focusing on a file
instead.</p>
<p>Let’s add a file to our <code>"pics"</code> folder and then move back
up to the root:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let newFocus = (myDisk,[]) -: fsTo &quot;pics&quot; -: fsNewFile (File &quot;heh.jpg&quot; &quot;lol&quot;) -: fsUp</code></pre>
<p>What’s really cool about all this is that when we modify our file
system, it doesn’t actually modify it in place but it returns a whole
new file system. That way, we have access to our old file system (in
this case, <code>myDisk</code>) as well as the new one (the first
component of <code>newFocus</code>). So by using zippers, we get
versioning for free, meaning that we can always refer to older versions
of data structures even after we’ve changed them, so to speak. This
isn’t unique to zippers, but is a property of Haskell because its data
structures are immutable. With zippers however, we get the ability to
easily and efficiently walk around our data structures, so the
persistence of Haskell’s data structures really begins to shine.</p>
<h2 id="watch-your-step">Watch your step</h2>
<p>So far, while walking through our data structures, whether they were
binary trees, lists or file systems, we didn’t really care if we took a
step too far and fell off. For instance, our <code>goLeft</code>
function takes a zipper of a binary tree and moves the focus to its left
subtree:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goLeft :: Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
goLeft (Node x l r, bs) = (l, LeftCrumb x r:bs)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/zippers/bigtree.png" class="right"
width="247" height="367" alt="falling for you" /></p>
<p>But what if the tree we’re stepping off from is an empty tree? That
is, what if it’s not a <code>Node</code>, but an <code>Empty</code>? In
this case, we’d get a runtime error because the pattern match would fail
and we have made no pattern to handle an empty tree, which doesn’t have
any subtrees at all. So far, we just assumed that we’d never try to
focus on the left subtree of an empty tree as its left subtree doesn’t
exist at all. But going to the left subtree of an empty tree doesn’t
make much sense, and so far we’ve just conveniently ignored this.</p>
<p>Or what if we were already at the root of some tree and didn’t have
any breadcrumbs but still tried to move up? The same thing would happen.
It seems that when using zippers, any step could be our last (cue
ominous music). In other words, any move can result in a success, but it
can also result in a failure. Does that remind you of something? Of
course, monads! More specifically, the <code>Maybe</code> monad which
adds a context of possible failure to normal values.</p>
<p>So let’s use the <code>Maybe</code> monad to add a context of
possible failure to our movements. We’re going to take the functions
that work on our binary tree zipper and we’re going to make them into
monadic functions. First, let’s take care of possible failure in
<code>goLeft</code> and <code>goRight</code>. So far, the failure of
functions that could fail was always reflected in their result, and this
time is no different. So here are <code>goLeft</code> and
<code>goRight</code> with an added possibility of failure:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goLeft :: Zipper a -&gt; Maybe (Zipper a)
goLeft (Node x l r, bs) = Just (l, LeftCrumb x r:bs)
goLeft (Empty, _) = Nothing

goRight :: Zipper a -&gt; Maybe (Zipper a)
goRight (Node x l r, bs) = Just (r, RightCrumb x l:bs)
goRight (Empty, _) = Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Cool, now if we try to take a step to the left of an empty tree, we
get a <code>Nothing</code>!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; goLeft (Empty, [])
Nothing
ghci&gt; goLeft (Node &#39;A&#39; Empty Empty, [])
Just (Empty,[LeftCrumb &#39;A&#39; Empty])</code></pre>
<p>Looks good! How about going up? The problem before happened if we
tried to go up but we didn’t have any more breadcrumbs, which meant that
we were already in the root of the tree. This is the <code>goUp</code>
function that throws an error if we don’t keep within the bounds of our
tree:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goUp :: Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
goUp (t, LeftCrumb x r:bs) = (Node x t r, bs)
goUp (t, RightCrumb x l:bs) = (Node x l t, bs)</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s modify it to fail gracefully:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>goUp :: Zipper a -&gt; Maybe (Zipper a)
goUp (t, LeftCrumb x r:bs) = Just (Node x t r, bs)
goUp (t, RightCrumb x l:bs) = Just (Node x l t, bs)
goUp (_, []) = Nothing</code></pre>
<p>If we have breadcrumbs, everything is okay and we return a successful
new focus, but if we don’t, then we return a failure.</p>
<p>Before, these functions took zippers and returned zippers, which
meant that we could chain them like this to walk around:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>gchi&gt; let newFocus = (freeTree,[]) -: goLeft -: goRight</code></pre>
<p>But now, instead of returning <code>Zipper a</code>, they return
<code>Maybe (Zipper a)</code>, so chaining functions like this won’t
work. We had a similar problem when we were <a
href="a-fistful-of-monads.html#walk-the-line">dealing with our tightrope
walker</a> in the chapter about monads. He also walked one step at a
time and each of his steps could result in failure because a bunch of
birds could land on one side of his balancing pole and make him
fall.</p>
<p>Now, the joke’s on us because we’re the ones doing the walking, and
we’re traversing a labyrinth of our own devising. Luckily, we can learn
from the tightrope walker and just do what he did, which is to exchange
normal function application for using <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, which
takes a value with a context (in our case, the
<code>Maybe (Zipper a)</code>, which has a context of possible failure)
and feeds it into a function while making sure that the context is taken
care of. So just like our tightrope walker, we’re going to trade in all
our <code>-:</code> operators for <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>. Alright, we
can chain our functions again! Watch:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let coolTree = Node 1 Empty (Node 3 Empty Empty)
ghci&gt; return (coolTree,[]) &gt;&gt;= goRight
Just (Node 3 Empty Empty,[RightCrumb 1 Empty])
ghci&gt; return (coolTree,[]) &gt;&gt;= goRight &gt;&gt;= goRight
Just (Empty,[RightCrumb 3 Empty,RightCrumb 1 Empty])
ghci&gt; return (coolTree,[]) &gt;&gt;= goRight &gt;&gt;= goRight &gt;&gt;= goRight
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>We used <code>return</code> to put a zipper in a <code>Just</code>
and then used <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed that to our
<code>goRight</code> function. First, we made a tree that has on its
left an empty subtree and on its right a node that has two empty
subtrees. When we try to go right once, the result is a success, because
the operation makes sense. Going right twice is okay too; we end up with
the focus on an empty subtree. But going right three times wouldn’t make
sense, because we can’t go to the right of an empty subtree, which is
why the result is a <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>Now we’ve equipped our trees with a safety-net that will catch us
should we fall off. Wow, I nailed this metaphor.</p>
<p>Our file system also has a lot of cases where an operation could
fail, such as trying to focus on a file or folder that doesn’t exist. As
an exercise, you can equip our file system with functions that fail
gracefully by using the <code>Maybe</code> monad.</p>
