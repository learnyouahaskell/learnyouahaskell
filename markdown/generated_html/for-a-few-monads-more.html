alt="there are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. those who learn them a haskell and those who have the job of coding java" /></p>
<p>We’ve seen how monads can be used to take values with contexts and
apply them to functions and how using <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> or
<code>do</code> notation allows us to focus on the values themselves
while the context gets handled for us.</p>
<p>We’ve met the <code>Maybe</code> monad and seen how it adds a context
of possible failure to values. We’ve learned about the list monad and
saw how it lets us easily introduce non-determinism into our programs.
We’ve also learned how to work in the <code>IO</code> monad, even before
we knew what a monad was!</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to learn about a few other monads. We’ll
see how they can make our programs clearer by letting us treat all sorts
of values as monadic ones. Exploring a few monads more will also
solidify our intuition for monads.</p>
<p>The monads that we’ll be exploring are all part of the
<code>mtl</code> package. A Haskell package is a collection of modules.
The <code>mtl</code> package comes with the Haskell Platform, so you
probably already have it. To check if you do, type
<code>ghc-pkg list</code> in the command-line. This will show which
Haskell packages you have installed and one of them should be
<code>mtl</code>, followed by a version number.</p>
<h2 id="writer">Writer? I hardly know her!</h2>
<p>We’ve loaded our gun with the <code>Maybe</code> monad, the list
monad and the <code>IO</code> monad. Now let’s put the
<code>Writer</code> monad in the chamber and see what happens when we
fire it!</p>
<p>Whereas <code>Maybe</code> is for values with an added context of
failure and the list is for non-deterministic values, the
<code>Writer</code> monad is for values that have another value attached
that acts as a sort of log value. <code>Writer</code> allows us to do
computations while making sure that all the log values are combined into
one log value that then gets attached to the result.</p>
<p>For instance, we might want to equip our values with strings that
explain what’s going on, probably for debugging purposes. Consider a
function that takes a number of bandits in a gang and tells us if that’s
a big gang or not. That’s a very simple function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>isBigGang :: Int -&gt; Bool
isBigGang x = x &gt; 9</code></pre>
<p>Now, what if instead of just giving us a <code>True</code> or
<code>False</code> value, we want it to also return a log string that
says what it did? Well, we just make that string and return it alongside
our <code>Bool</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>isBigGang :: Int -&gt; (Bool, String)
isBigGang x = (x &gt; 9, &quot;Compared gang size to 9.&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>So now instead of just returning a <code>Bool</code>, we return a
tuple where the first component of the tuple is the actual value and the
second component is the string that accompanies that value. There’s some
added context to our value now. Let’s give this a go:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; isBigGang 3
(False,&quot;Compared gang size to 9.&quot;)
ghci&gt; isBigGang 30
(True,&quot;Compared gang size to 9.&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/tuco.png" class="left"
width="196" height="280"
alt="when you have to poop, poop, don’t talk" /></p>
<p>So far so good. <code>isBigGang</code> takes a normal value and
returns a value with a context. As we’ve just seen, feeding it a normal
value is not a problem. Now what if we already have a value that has a
log string attached to it, such as <code>(3, "Smallish gang.")</code>,
and we want to feed it to <code>isBigGang</code>? It seems like once
again, we’re faced with this question: if we have a function that takes
a normal value and returns a value with a context, how do we take a
value with a context and feed it to the function?</p>
<p>When we were exploring the <code>Maybe</code> monad, we made a
function <code>applyMaybe</code>, which took a <code>Maybe a</code>
value and a function of type <code>a -&gt; Maybe b</code> and fed that
<code>Maybe a</code> value into the function, even though the function
takes a normal <code>a</code> instead of a <code>Maybe a</code>. It did
this by minding the context that comes with <code>Maybe a</code> values,
which is that they are values with possible failure. But inside the
<code>a -&gt; Maybe b</code> function, we were able to treat that value
as just a normal value, because <code>applyMaybe</code> (which later
became <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) took care of checking if it was a
<code>Nothing</code> or a <code>Just</code> value.</p>
<p>In the same vein, let’s make a function that takes a value with an
attached log, that is, an <code>(a,String)</code> value and a function
of type <code>a -&gt; (b,String)</code> and feeds that value into the
function. We’ll call it <code>applyLog</code>. But because an
<code>(a,String)</code> value doesn’t carry with it a context of
possible failure, but rather a context of an additional log value,
<code>applyLog</code> is going to make sure that the log of the original
value isn’t lost, but is joined together with the log of the value that
results from the function. Here’s the implementation of
<code>applyLog</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>applyLog :: (a,String) -&gt; (a -&gt; (b,String)) -&gt; (b,String)
applyLog (x,log) f = let (y,newLog) = f x in (y,log ++ newLog)</code></pre>
<p>When we have a value with a context and we want to feed it to a
function, we usually try to separate the actual value from the context
and then try to apply the function to the value and then see that the
context is taken care of. In the <code>Maybe</code> monad, we checked if
the value was a <code>Just x</code> and if it was, we took that
<code>x</code> and applied the function to it. In this case, it’s very
easy to find the actual value, because we’re dealing with a pair where
one component is the value and the other a log. So first we just take
the value, which is <code>x</code> and we apply the function
<code>f</code> to it. We get a pair of <code>(y,newLog)</code>, where
<code>y</code> is the new result and <code>newLog</code> the new log.
But if we returned that as the result, the old log value wouldn’t be
included in the result, so we return a pair of
<code>(y,log ++ newLog)</code>. We use <code>++</code> to append the new
log to the old one.</p>
<p>Here’s <code>applyLog</code> in action:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (3, &quot;Smallish gang.&quot;) `applyLog` isBigGang
(False,&quot;Smallish gang.Compared gang size to 9&quot;)
ghci&gt; (30, &quot;A freaking platoon.&quot;) `applyLog` isBigGang
(True,&quot;A freaking platoon.Compared gang size to 9&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The results are similar to before, only now the number of people in
the gang had its accompanying log and it got included in the result log.
Here are a few more examples of using <code>applyLog</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (&quot;Tobin&quot;,&quot;Got outlaw name.&quot;) `applyLog` (\x -&gt; (length x, &quot;Applied length.&quot;))
(5,&quot;Got outlaw name.Applied length.&quot;)
ghci&gt; (&quot;Bathcat&quot;,&quot;Got outlaw name.&quot;) `applyLog` (\x -&gt; (length x, &quot;Applied length&quot;))
(7,&quot;Got outlaw name.Applied length&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>See how inside the lambda, <code>x</code> is just a normal string and
not a tuple and how <code>applyLog</code> takes care of appending the
logs.</p>
<h3 id="monoids-to-the-rescue">Monoids to the rescue</h3>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>Be sure you know what <a
href="functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids.html#monoids">monoids</a>
are at this point! Cheers.</p>
</div>
<p>Right now, <code>applyLog</code> takes values of type
<code>(a,String)</code>, but is there a reason that the log has to be a
<code>String</code>? It uses <code>++</code> to append the logs, so
wouldn’t this work on any kind of list, not just a list of characters?
Sure it would. We can go ahead and change its type to this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>applyLog :: (a,[c]) -&gt; (a -&gt; (b,[c])) -&gt; (b,[c])</code></pre>
<p>Now, the log is a list. The type of values contained in the list has
to be the same for the original list as well as for the list that the
function returns, otherwise we wouldn’t be able to use <code>++</code>
to stick them together.</p>
<p>Would this work for bytestrings? There’s no reason it shouldn’t.
However, the type we have now only works for lists. It seems like we’d
have to make a separate <code>applyLog</code> for bytestrings. But wait!
Both lists and bytestrings are monoids. As such, they are both instances
of the <code>Monoid</code> type class, which means that they implement
the <code>mappend</code> function. And for both lists and bytestrings,
<code>mappend</code> is for appending. Watch:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [1,2,3] `mappend` [4,5,6]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
ghci&gt; B.pack [99,104,105] `mappend` B.pack [104,117,97,104,117,97]
Chunk &quot;chi&quot; (Chunk &quot;huahua&quot; Empty)</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Now our <code>applyLog</code> can work for any monoid. We have
to change the type to reflect this, as well as the implementation,
because we have to change <code>++</code> to <code>mappend</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>applyLog :: (Monoid m) =&gt; (a,m) -&gt; (a -&gt; (b,m)) -&gt; (b,m)
applyLog (x,log) f = let (y,newLog) = f x in (y,log `mappend` newLog)</code></pre>
<p>Because the accompanying value can now be any monoid value, we no
longer have to think of the tuple as a value and a log, but now we can
think of it as a value with an accompanying monoid value. For instance,
we can have a tuple that has an item name and an item price as the
monoid value. We just use the <code>Sum</code> newtype to make sure that
the prices get added as we operate with the items. Here’s a function
that adds drink to some cowboy food:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.Monoid

type Food = String
type Price = Sum Int

addDrink :: Food -&gt; (Food,Price)
addDrink &quot;beans&quot; = (&quot;milk&quot;, Sum 25)
addDrink &quot;jerky&quot; = (&quot;whiskey&quot;, Sum 99)
addDrink _ = (&quot;beer&quot;, Sum 30)</code></pre>
<p>We use strings to represent foods and an <code>Int</code> in a
<code>Sum</code> <code>newtype</code> wrapper to keep track of how many
cents something costs. Just a reminder, doing <code>mappend</code> with
<code>Sum</code> results in the wrapped values getting added
together:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Sum 3 `mappend` Sum 9
Sum {getSum = 12}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>addDrink</code> function is pretty simple. If we’re eating
beans, it returns <code>"milk"</code> along with <code>Sum 25</code>, so
25 cents wrapped in <code>Sum</code>. If we’re eating jerky we drink
whiskey and if we’re eating anything else we drink beer. Just normally
applying this function to a food wouldn’t be terribly interesting right
now, but using <code>applyLog</code> to feed a food that comes with a
price itself into this function is interesting:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (&quot;beans&quot;, Sum 10) `applyLog` addDrink
(&quot;milk&quot;,Sum {getSum = 35})
ghci&gt; (&quot;jerky&quot;, Sum 25) `applyLog` addDrink
(&quot;whiskey&quot;,Sum {getSum = 124})
ghci&gt; (&quot;dogmeat&quot;, Sum 5) `applyLog` addDrink
(&quot;beer&quot;,Sum {getSum = 35})</code></pre>
<p>Milk costs <code>25</code> cents, but if we eat it with beans that
cost <code>10</code> cents, we’ll end up paying <code>35</code> cents.
Now it’s clear how the attached value doesn’t always have to be a log,
it can be any monoid value and how two such values are combined into one
depends on the monoid. When we were doing logs, they got appended, but
now, the numbers are being added up.</p>
<p>Because the value that <code>addDrink</code> returns is a tuple of
type <code>(Food,Price)</code>, we can feed that result to
<code>addDrink</code> again, so that it tells us what we should drink
along with our drink and how much that will cost us. Let’s give it a
shot:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (&quot;dogmeat&quot;, Sum 5) `applyLog` addDrink `applyLog` addDrink
(&quot;beer&quot;,Sum {getSum = 65})</code></pre>
<p>Adding a drink to some dog meat results in a beer and an additional
<code>30</code> cents, so <code>("beer", Sum 35)</code>. And if we use
<code>applyLog</code> to feed that to <code>addDrink</code>, we get
another beer and the result is <code>("beer", Sum 65)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="the-writer-type">The Writer type</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve seen that a value with an attached monoid acts like a
monadic value, let’s examine the <code>Monad</code> instance for types
of such values. The <code>Control.Monad.Writer</code> module exports the
<code>Writer w a</code> type along with its <code>Monad</code> instance
and some useful functions for dealing with values of this type.</p>
<p>First, let’s examine the type itself. To attach a monoid to a value,
we just need to put them together in a tuple. The
<code>Writer w a</code> type is just a <code>newtype</code> wrapper for
this. Its definition is very simple:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype Writer w a = Writer { runWriter :: (a, w) }</code></pre>
<p>It’s wrapped in a <code>newtype</code> so that it can be made an
instance of <code>Monad</code> and that its type is separate from a
normal tuple. The <code>a</code> type parameter represents the type of
the value and the <code>w</code> type parameter the type of the attached
monoid value.</p>
<p>Its <code>Monad</code> instance is defined like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance (Monoid w) =&gt; Monad (Writer w) where
    return x = Writer (x, mempty)
    (Writer (x,v)) &gt;&gt;= f = let (Writer (y, v&#39;)) = f x in Writer (y, v `mappend` v&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/angeleyes.png"
class="right" width="383" height="248"
alt="when you have to poop, poop, don’t talk" /></p>
<p>First off, let’s examine <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>. Its implementation
is essentially the same as <code>applyLog</code>, only now that our
tuple is wrapped in the <code>Writer</code> <code>newtype</code>, we
have to unwrap it when pattern matching. We take the value
<code>x</code> and apply the function <code>f</code> to it. This gives
us a <code>Writer w a</code> value and we use a <code>let</code>
expression to pattern match on it. We present <code>y</code> as the new
result and use <code>mappend</code> to combine the old monoid value with
the new one. We pack that up with the result value in a tuple and then
wrap that with the <code>Writer</code> constructor so that our result is
a <code>Writer</code> value instead of just an unwrapped tuple.</p>
<p>So, what about <code>return</code>? It has to take a value and put it
in a default minimal context that still presents that value as the
result. So what would such a context be for <code>Writer</code> values?
If we want the accompanying monoid value to affect other monoid values
as little as possible, it makes sense to use <code>mempty</code>.
<code>mempty</code> is used to present identity monoid values, such as
<code>""</code> and <code>Sum 0</code> and empty bytestrings. Whenever
we use <code>mappend</code> between <code>mempty</code> and some other
monoid value, the result is that other monoid value. So if we use
<code>return</code> to make a <code>Writer</code> value and then use
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed that value to a function, the resulting
monoid value will be only what the function returns. Let’s use
<code>return</code> on the number <code>3</code> a bunch of times, only
we’ll pair it with a different monoid every time:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; runWriter (return 3 :: Writer String Int)
(3,&quot;&quot;)
ghci&gt; runWriter (return 3 :: Writer (Sum Int) Int)
(3,Sum {getSum = 0})
ghci&gt; runWriter (return 3 :: Writer (Product Int) Int)
(3,Product {getProduct = 1})</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>Writer</code> doesn’t have a <code>Show</code>
instance, we had to use <code>runWriter</code> to convert our
<code>Writer</code> values to normal tuples that can be shown. For
<code>String</code>, the monoid value is the empty string. With
<code>Sum</code>, it’s <code>0</code>, because if we add 0 to something,
that something stays the same. For <code>Product</code>, the identity is
<code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>Writer</code> instance doesn’t feature an implementation
for <code>fail</code>, so if a pattern match fails in <code>do</code>
notation, <code>error</code> is called.</p>
<h3 id="using-do-notation-with-writer">Using do notation with
Writer</h3>
<p>Now that we have a <code>Monad</code> instance, we’re free to use
<code>do</code> notation for <code>Writer</code> values. It’s handy for
when we have a several <code>Writer</code> values and we want to do
stuff with them. Like with other monads, we can treat them as normal
values and the context gets taken for us. In this case, all the monoid
values that come attached get <code>mappend</code>ed and so are
reflected in the final result. Here’s a simple example of using
<code>do</code> notation with <code>Writer</code> to multiply two
numbers:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Control.Monad.Writer

logNumber :: Int -&gt; Writer [String] Int
logNumber x = Writer (x, [&quot;Got number: &quot; ++ show x])

multWithLog :: Writer [String] Int
multWithLog = do
    a &lt;- logNumber 3
    b &lt;- logNumber 5
    return (a*b)</code></pre>
<p><code>logNumber</code> takes a number and makes a <code>Writer</code>
value out of it. For the monoid, we use a list of strings and we equip
the number with a singleton list that just says that we have that
number. <code>multWithLog</code> is a <code>Writer</code> value which
multiplies <code>3</code> and <code>5</code> and makes sure that their
attached logs get included in the final log. We use <code>return</code>
to present <code>a*b</code> as the result. Because <code>return</code>
just takes something and puts it in a minimal context, we can be sure
that it won’t add anything to the log. Here’s what we see if we run
this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; runWriter multWithLog
(15,[&quot;Got number: 3&quot;,&quot;Got number: 5&quot;])</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes we just want some monoid value to be included at some
particular point. For this, the <code>tell</code> function is useful.
It’s part of the <code>MonadWriter</code> type class and in the case of
<code>Writer</code> it takes a monoid value, like
<code>["This is going on"]</code> and creates a <code>Writer</code>
value that presents the dummy value <code>()</code> as its result but
has our desired monoid value attached. When we have a monadic value that
has <code>()</code> as its result, we don’t bind it to a variable.
Here’s <code>multWithLog</code> but with some extra reporting
included:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>multWithLog :: Writer [String] Int
multWithLog = do
    a &lt;- logNumber 3
    b &lt;- logNumber 5
    tell [&quot;Gonna multiply these two&quot;]
    return (a*b)</code></pre>
<p>It’s important that <code>return (a*b)</code> is the last line,
because the result of the last line in a <code>do</code> expression is
the result of the whole <code>do</code> expression. Had we put
<code>tell</code> as the last line, <code>()</code> would have been the
result of this <code>do</code> expression. We’d lose the result of the
multiplication. However, the log would be the same. Here is this in
action:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; runWriter multWithLog
(15,[&quot;Got number: 3&quot;,&quot;Got number: 5&quot;,&quot;Gonna multiply these two&quot;])</code></pre>
<h3 id="adding-logging-to-programs">Adding logging to programs</h3>
<p>Euclid’s algorithm is an algorithm that takes two numbers and
computes their greatest common divisor. That is, the biggest number that
still divides both of them. Haskell already features the
<code>gcd</code> function, which does exactly this, but let’s implement
our own and then equip it with logging capabilities. Here’s the normal
algorithm:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>gcd&#39; :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
gcd&#39; a b
    | b == 0    = a
    | otherwise = gcd&#39; b (a `mod` b)</code></pre>
<p>The algorithm is very simple. First, it checks if the second number
is 0. If it is, then the result is the first number. If it isn’t, then
the result is the greatest common divisor of the second number and the
remainder of dividing the first number with the second one. For
instance, if we want to know what the greatest common divisor of 8 and 3
is, we just follow the algorithm outlined. Because 3 isn’t 0, we have to
find the greatest common divisor of 3 and 2 (if we divide 8 by 3, the
remainder is 2). Next, we find the greatest common divisor of 3 and 2. 2
still isn’t 0, so now we have 2 and 1. The second number isn’t 0, so we
run the algorithm again for 1 and 0, as dividing 2 by 1 gives us a
remainder of 0. And finally, because the second number is now 0, the
final result is 1. Let’s see if our code agrees:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; gcd&#39; 8 3
1</code></pre>
<p>It does. Very good! Now, we want to equip our result with a context,
and the context will be a monoid value that acts as a log. Like before,
we’ll use a list of strings as our monoid. So the type of our new
<code>gcd'</code> function should be:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>gcd&#39; :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Writer [String] Int</code></pre>
<p>All that’s left now is to equip our function with log values. Here’s
the code:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Control.Monad.Writer

gcd&#39; :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Writer [String] Int
gcd&#39; a b
    | b == 0 = do
        tell [&quot;Finished with &quot; ++ show a]
        return a
    | otherwise = do
        tell [show a ++ &quot; mod &quot; ++ show b ++ &quot; = &quot; ++ show (a `mod` b)]
        gcd&#39; b (a `mod` b)</code></pre>
<p>This function takes two normal <code>Int</code> values and returns a
<code>Writer [String] Int</code>, that is, an <code>Int</code> that has
a log context. In the case where <code>b</code> is <code>0</code>,
instead of just giving <code>a</code> as the result, we use a
<code>do</code> expression to put together a <code>Writer</code> value
as a result. First we use <code>tell</code> to report that we’re
finished and then we use <code>return</code> to present <code>a</code>
as the result of the <code>do</code> expression. Instead of this
<code>do</code> expression, we could have also written this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>Writer (a, [&quot;Finished with &quot; ++ show a])</code></pre>
<p>However, I think the <code>do</code> expression is easier to read.
Next, we have the case when <code>b</code> isn’t <code>0</code>. In this
case, we log that we’re using <code>mod</code> to figure out the
remainder of dividing <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Then, the
second line of the <code>do</code> expression just recursively calls
<code>gcd'</code>. Remember, <code>gcd'</code> now ultimately returns a
<code>Writer</code> value, so it’s perfectly valid that
<code>gcd' b (a `mod` b)</code> is a line in a <code>do</code>
expression.</p>
<p>While it may be kind of useful to trace the execution of this new
<code>gcd'</code> by hand to see how the logs get appended, I think it’s
more insightful to just look at the big picture and view these as values
with a context and from that gain insight as to what the final result
will be.</p>
<p>Let’s try our new <code>gcd'</code> out. Its result is a
<code>Writer [String] Int</code> value and if we unwrap that from its
<code>newtype</code>, we get a tuple. The first part of the tuple is the
result. Let’s see if it’s okay:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fst $ runWriter (gcd&#39; 8 3)
1</code></pre>
<p>Good! Now what about the log? Because the log is a list of strings,
let’s use <code>mapM_ putStrLn</code> to print those strings to the
screen:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn $ snd $ runWriter (gcd&#39; 8 3)
8 mod 3 = 2
3 mod 2 = 1
2 mod 1 = 0
Finished with 1</code></pre>
<p>I think it’s awesome how we were able to change our ordinary
algorithm to one that reports what it does as it goes along just by
changing normal values to monadic values and letting the implementation
of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> for <code>Writer</code> take care of the logs
for us. We can add a logging mechanism to pretty much any function. We
just replace normal values with <code>Writer</code> values where we want
and change normal function application to <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> (or
<code>do</code> expressions if it increases readability).</p>
<h3 id="inefficient-list-construction">Inefficient list
construction</h3>
<p>When using the <code>Writer</code> monad, you have to be careful
which monoid to use, because using lists can sometimes turn out to be
very slow. That’s because lists use <code>++</code> for
<code>mappend</code> and using <code>++</code> to add something to the
end of a list is slow if that list is really long.</p>
<p>In our <code>gcd'</code> function, the logging is fast because the
list appending ends up looking like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>a ++ (b ++ (c ++ (d ++ (e ++ f))))</code></pre>
<p>Lists are a data structure that’s constructed from left to right, and
this is efficient because we first fully construct the left part of a
list and only then add a longer list on the right. But if we’re not
careful, using the <code>Writer</code> monad can produce list appending
that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>((((a ++ b) ++ c) ++ d) ++ e) ++ f</code></pre>
<p>This associates to the left instead of to the right. This is
inefficient because every time it wants to add the right part to the
left part, it has to construct the left part all the way from the
beginning!</p>
<p>The following function works like <code>gcd'</code>, only it logs
stuff in reverse. First it produces the log for the rest of the
procedure and then adds the current step to the end of the log.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Control.Monad.Writer

gcdReverse :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Writer [String] Int
gcdReverse a b
    | b == 0 = do
        tell [&quot;Finished with &quot; ++ show a]
        return a
    | otherwise = do
        result &lt;- gcdReverse b (a `mod` b)
        tell [show a ++ &quot; mod &quot; ++ show b ++ &quot; = &quot; ++ show (a `mod` b)]
        return result</code></pre>
<p>It does the recursion first, and binds its result value to
<code>result</code>. Then it adds the current step to the log, but the
current step goes at the end of the log that was produced by the
recursion. Finally, it presents the result of the recursion as the final
result. Here it is in action:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn $ snd $ runWriter (gcdReverse 8 3)
Finished with 1
2 mod 1 = 0
3 mod 2 = 1
8 mod 3 = 2</code></pre>
<p>It’s inefficient because it ends up associating the use of
<code>++</code> to the left instead of to the right.</p>
<h3 id="difference-lists">Difference lists</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/cactus.png"
class="left" width="147" height="300" alt="cactuses" /></p>
<p>Because lists can sometimes be inefficient when repeatedly appended
in this manner, it’s best to use a data structure that always supports
efficient appending. One such data structure is the difference list. A
difference list is similar to a list, only instead of being a normal
list, it’s a function that takes a list and prepends another list to it.
The difference list equivalent of a list like <code>[1,2,3]</code> would
be the function <code>\xs -&gt; [1,2,3] ++ xs</code>. A normal empty
list is <code>[]</code>, whereas an empty difference list is the
function <code>\xs -&gt; [] ++ xs</code>.</p>
<p>The cool thing about difference lists is that they support efficient
appending. When we append two normal lists with <code>++</code>, it has
to walk all the way to the end of the list on the left of
<code>++</code> and then stick the other one there. But what if we take
the difference list approach and represent our lists as functions? Well
then, appending two difference lists can be done like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>f `append` g = \xs -&gt; f (g xs)</code></pre>
<p>Remember, <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are functions that take
lists and prepend something to them. So, for instance, if <code>f</code>
is the function <code>("dog"++)</code> (just another way of writing
<code>\xs -&gt; "dog" ++ xs</code>) and <code>g</code> the function
<code>("meat"++)</code>, then <code>f `append` g</code> makes a new
function that’s equivalent to the following:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>\xs -&gt; &quot;dog&quot; ++ (&quot;meat&quot; ++ xs)</code></pre>
<p>We’ve appended two difference lists just by making a new function
that first applies one difference list some list and then the other.</p>
<p>Let’s make a <code>newtype</code> wrapper for difference lists so
that we can easily give them monoid instances:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype DiffList a = DiffList { getDiffList :: [a] -&gt; [a] }</code></pre>
<p>The type that we wrap is <code>[a] -&gt; [a]</code> because a
difference list is just a function that takes a list and returns
another. Converting normal lists to difference lists and vice versa is
easy:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>toDiffList :: [a] -&gt; DiffList a
toDiffList xs = DiffList (xs++)

fromDiffList :: DiffList a -&gt; [a]
fromDiffList (DiffList f) = f []</code></pre>
<p>To make a normal list into a difference list we just do what we did
before and make it a function that prepends it to another list. Because
a difference list is a function that prepends something to another list,
if we just want that something, we apply the function to an empty
list!</p>
<p>Here’s the <code>Monoid</code> instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monoid (DiffList a) where
    mempty = DiffList (\xs -&gt; [] ++ xs)
    (DiffList f) `mappend` (DiffList g) = DiffList (\xs -&gt; f (g xs))</code></pre>
<p>Notice how for lists, <code>mempty</code> is just the <code>id</code>
function and <code>mappend</code> is actually just function composition.
Let’s see if this works:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fromDiffList (toDiffList [1,2,3,4] `mappend` toDiffList [1,2,3])
[1,2,3,4,1,2,3]</code></pre>
<p>Tip top! Now we can increase the efficiency of our
<code>gcdReverse</code> function by making it use difference lists
instead of normal lists:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Control.Monad.Writer

gcd&#39; :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Writer (DiffList String) Int
gcd&#39; a b
    | b == 0 = do
        tell (toDiffList [&quot;Finished with &quot; ++ show a])
        return a
    | otherwise = do
        result &lt;- gcd&#39; b (a `mod` b)
        tell (toDiffList [show a ++ &quot; mod &quot; ++ show b ++ &quot; = &quot; ++ show (a `mod` b)])
        return result</code></pre>
<p>We only had to change the type of the monoid from
<code>[String]</code> to <code>DiffList String</code> and then when
using <code>tell</code>, convert our normal lists into difference lists
with <code>toDiffList</code>. Let’s see if the log gets assembled
properly:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn . fromDiffList . snd . runWriter $ gcdReverse 110 34
Finished with 2
8 mod 2 = 0
34 mod 8 = 2
110 mod 34 = 8</code></pre>
<p>We do <code>gcdReverse 110 34</code>, then use <code>runWriter</code>
to unwrap it from the <code>newtype</code>, then apply <code>snd</code>
to that to just get the log, then apply <code>fromDiffList</code> to
convert it to a normal list and then finally print its entries to the
screen.</p>
<h3 id="comparing-performance">Comparing Performance</h3>
<p>To get a feel for just how much difference lists may improve your
performance, consider this function that just counts down from some
number to zero, but produces its log in reverse, like
<code>gcdReverse</code>, so that the numbers in the log will actually be
counted up:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>finalCountDown :: Int -&gt; Writer (DiffList String) ()
finalCountDown 0 = do
    tell (toDiffList [&quot;0&quot;])
finalCountDown x = do
    finalCountDown (x-1)
    tell (toDiffList [show x])</code></pre>
<p>If we give it <code>0</code>, it just logs it. For any other number,
it first counts down its predecessor to <code>0</code> and then appends
that number to the log. So if we apply <code>finalCountDown</code> to
<code>100</code>, the string <code>"100"</code> will come last in the
log.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you load this function in GHCi and apply it to a big
number, like <code>500000</code>, you’ll see that it quickly starts
counting from <code>0</code> onwards:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn . fromDiffList . snd . runWriter $ finalCountDown 500000
0
1
2
...</code></pre>
<p>However, if we change it to use normal lists instead of difference
lists, like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>finalCountDown :: Int -&gt; Writer [String] ()
finalCountDown 0 = do
    tell [&quot;0&quot;]
finalCountDown x = do
    finalCountDown (x-1)
    tell [show x]</code></pre>
<p>And then tell GHCi to start counting:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn . snd . runWriter $ finalCountDown 500000</code></pre>
<p>We’ll see that the counting is really slow.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the proper and scientific way to test how fast
our programs are, but we were able to see that in this case, using
difference lists starts producing results right away whereas normal
lists take forever.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, the song Final Countdown by Europe is now stuck in
your head. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="reader">Reader? Ugh, not this joke again.</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/revolver.png"
class="left" width="280" height="106" alt="bang youre dead" /></p>
<p>In the <a
href="functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids.html">chapter about
applicatives</a>, we saw that the function type, <code>(-&gt;) r</code>
is an instance of <code>Functor</code>. Mapping a function
<code>f</code> over a function <code>g</code> will make a function that
takes the same thing as <code>g</code>, applies <code>g</code> to it and
then applies <code>f</code> to that result. So basically, we’re making a
new function that’s like <code>g</code>, only before returning its
result, <code>f</code> gets applied to that result as well. For
instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let f = (*5)
ghci&gt; let g = (+3)
ghci&gt; (fmap f g) 8
55</code></pre>
<p>We’ve also seen that functions are applicative functors. They allow
us to operate on the eventual results of functions as if we already had
their results. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let f = (+) &lt;$&gt; (*2) &lt;*&gt; (+10)
ghci&gt; f 3
19</code></pre>
<p>The expression <code>(+) &lt;$&gt; (*2) &lt;*&gt; (+10)</code> makes
a function that takes a number, gives that number to <code>(*2)</code>
and <code>(+10)</code> and then adds together the results. For instance,
if we apply this function to <code>3</code>, it applies both
<code>(*2)</code> and <code>(+10)</code> to <code>3</code>, giving
<code>6</code> and <code>13</code>. Then, it calls <code>(+)</code> with
<code>6</code> and <code>13</code> and the result is
<code>19</code>.</p>
<p>Not only is the function type <code>(-&gt;) r</code> a functor and an
applicative functor, but it’s also a monad. Just like other monadic
values that we’ve met so far, a function can also be considered a value
with a context. The context for functions is that that value is not
present yet and that we have to apply that function to something in
order to get its result value.</p>
<p>Because we’re already acquainted with how functions work as functors
and applicative functors, let’s dive right in and see what their
<code>Monad</code> instance looks like. It’s located in
<code>Control.Monad.Instances</code> and it goes a little something like
this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monad ((-&gt;) r) where
    return x = \_ -&gt; x
    h &gt;&gt;= f = \w -&gt; f (h w) w</code></pre>
<p>We’ve already seen how <code>pure</code> is implemented for
functions, and <code>return</code> is pretty much the same thing as
<code>pure</code>. It takes a value and puts it in a minimal context
that always has that value as its result. And the only way to make a
function that always has a certain value as its result is to make it
completely ignore its parameter.</p>
<p>The implementation for <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> seems a bit cryptic,
but it’s really not all that. When we use <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed
a monadic value to a function, the result is always a monadic value. So
in this case, when we feed a function to another function, the result is
a function as well. That’s why the result starts off as a lambda. All of
the implementations of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> so far always somehow
isolated the result from the monadic value and then applied the function
<code>f</code> to that result. The same thing happens here. To get the
result from a function, we have to apply it to something, which is why
we do <code>(h w)</code> here to get the result from the function and
then we apply <code>f</code> to that. <code>f</code> returns a monadic
value, which is a function in our case, so we apply it to <code>w</code>
as well.</p>
<p>If you don’t understand how <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> works at this
point, don’t worry, because with examples we’ll see how this is a really
simple monad. Here’s a <code>do</code> expression that utilizes this
monad:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Control.Monad.Instances

addStuff :: Int -&gt; Int
addStuff = do
    a &lt;- (*2)
    b &lt;- (+10)
    return (a+b)</code></pre>
<p>This is the same thing as the applicative expression that we wrote
earlier, only now it relies on functions being monads. A <code>do</code>
expression always results in a monadic value and this one is no
different. The result of this monadic value is a function. What happens
here is that it takes a number and then <code>(*2)</code> gets applied
to that number and the result becomes <code>a</code>. <code>(+10)</code>
is applied to the same number that <code>(*2)</code> got applied to and
the result becomes <code>b</code>. <code>return</code>, like in other
monads, doesn’t have any other effect but to make a monadic value that
presents some result. This presents <code>a+b</code> as the result of
this function. If we test it out, we get the same result as before:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; addStuff 3
19</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>(*2)</code> and <code>(+10)</code> get applied to the
number <code>3</code> in this case. <code>return (a+b)</code> does as
well, but it ignores it and always presents <code>a+b</code> as the
result. For this reason, the function monad is also called the reader
monad. All the functions read from a common source. To illustrate this
even better, we can rewrite <code>addStuff</code> like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>addStuff :: Int -&gt; Int
addStuff x = let
    a = (*2) x
    b = (+10) x
    in a+b</code></pre>
<p>We see that the reader monad allows us to treat functions as values
with a context. We can act as if we already know what the functions will
return. It does this by gluing functions together into one function and
then giving that function’s parameter to all of the functions that it
was glued from. So if we have a lot of functions that are all just
missing one parameter and they’d eventually be applied to the same
thing, we can use the reader monad to sort of extract their future
results and the <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> implementation will make sure
that it all works out.</p>
<h2 id="state">Tasteful stateful computations</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/texas.png" class="left"
width="244" height="230" alt="don’t jest with texas" /></p>
<p>Haskell is a pure language and because of that, our programs are made
of functions that can’t change any global state or variables, they can
only do some computations and return them results. This restriction
actually makes it easier to think about our programs, as it frees us
from worrying what every variable’s value is at some point in time.
However, some problems are inherently stateful in that they rely on some
state that changes over time. While such problems aren’t a problem for
Haskell, they can be a bit tedious to model sometimes. That’s why
Haskell features a thing called the state monad, which makes dealing
with stateful problems a breeze while still keeping everything nice and
pure.</p>
<p><a href="input-and-output.html#randomness">When we were dealing with
random numbers</a>, we dealt with functions that took a random generator
as a parameter and returned a random number and a new random generator.
If we wanted to generate several random numbers, we always had to use
the random generator that a previous function returned along with its
result. When making a function that takes a <code>StdGen</code> and
tosses a coin three times based on that generator, we had to do
this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>threeCoins :: StdGen -&gt; (Bool, Bool, Bool)
threeCoins gen =
    let (firstCoin, newGen) = random gen
        (secondCoin, newGen&#39;) = random newGen
        (thirdCoin, newGen&#39;&#39;) = random newGen&#39;
    in  (firstCoin, secondCoin, thirdCoin)</code></pre>
<p>It took a generator <code>gen</code> and then <code>random gen</code>
returned a <code>Bool</code> value along with a new generator. To throw
the second coin, we used the new generator, and so on. In most other
languages, we wouldn’t have to return a new generator along with a
random number. We could just modify the existing one! But since Haskell
is pure, we can’t do that, so we had to take some state, make a result
from it and a new state and then use that new state to generate new
results.</p>
<p>You’d think that to avoid manually dealing with stateful computations
in this way, we’d have to give up the purity of Haskell. Well, we don’t
have to, since there exist a special little monad called the state monad
which handles all this state business for us and without giving up any
of the purity that makes Haskell programming so cool.</p>
<p>So, to help us understand this concept of stateful computations
better, let’s go ahead and give them a type. We’ll say that a stateful
computation is a function that takes some state and returns a value
along with some new state. That function would have the following
type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>s -&gt; (a,s)</code></pre>
<p><code>s</code> is the type of the state and <code>a</code> the result
of the stateful computations.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>Assignment in most other languages could be thought of as a stateful
computation. For instance, when we do <code>x = 5</code> in an
imperative language, it will usually assign the value <code>5</code> to
the variable <code>x</code> and it will also have the value
<code>5</code> as an expression. If you look at that functionally, you
could look at it as a function that takes a state (that is, all the
variables that have been assigned previously) and returns a result (in
this case <code>5</code>) and a new state, which would be all the
previous variable mappings plus the newly assigned variable.</p>
</div>
<p>This stateful computation, a function that takes a state and returns
a result and a new state, can be thought of as a value with a context as
well. The actual value is the result, whereas the context is that we
have to provide some initial state to actually get that result and that
apart from getting a result we also get a new state.</p>
<h3 id="stacks-and-stones">Stacks and stones</h3>
<p>Say we want to model operating a stack. You have a stack of things
one on top of another and you can either push stuff on top of that stack
or you can take stuff off the top of the stack. When you’re putting an
item on top of the stack we say that you’re pushing it to the stack and
when you’re taking stuff off the top we say that you’re popping it. If
you want something that’s at the bottom of the stack, you have to pop
everything that’s above it.</p>
<p>We’ll use a list to represent our stack and the head of the list will
be the top of the stack. To help us with our task, we’ll make two
functions: <code>pop</code> and <code>push</code>. <code>pop</code> will
take a stack, pop one item and return that item as the result and also
return a new stack, without that item. <code>push</code> will take an
item and a stack and then push that item onto the stack. It will return
<code>()</code> as its result, along with a new stack. Here goes:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type Stack = [Int]

pop :: Stack -&gt; (Int,Stack)
pop (x:xs) = (x,xs)

push :: Int -&gt; Stack -&gt; ((),Stack)
push a xs = ((),a:xs)</code></pre>
<p>We used <code>()</code> as the result when pushing to the stack
because pushing an item onto the stack doesn’t have any important result
value, its main job is to change the stack. Notice how we just apply the
first parameter of <code>push</code>, we get a stateful computation.
<code>pop</code> is already a stateful computation because of its
type.</p>
<p>Let’s write a small piece of code to simulate a stack using these
functions. We’ll take a stack, push <code>3</code> to it and then pop
two items, just for kicks. Here it is:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>stackManip :: Stack -&gt; (Int, Stack)
stackManip stack = let
    ((),newStack1) = push 3 stack
    (a ,newStack2) = pop newStack1
    in pop newStack2</code></pre>
<p>We take a <code>stack</code> and then we do
<code>push 3 stack</code>, which results in a tuple. The first part of
the tuple is a <code>()</code> and the second is a new stack and we call
it <code>newStack1</code>. Then, we pop a number from
<code>newStack1</code>, which results in a number <code>a</code> (which
is the <code>3</code>) that we pushed and a new stack which we call
<code>newStack2</code>. Then, we pop a number off <code>newStack2</code>
and we get a number that’s <code>b</code> and a <code>newStack3</code>.
We return a tuple with that number and that stack. Let’s try it out:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; stackManip [5,8,2,1]
(5,[8,2,1])</code></pre>
<p>Cool, the result is <code>5</code> and the new stack is
<code>[8,2,1]</code>. Notice how <code>stackManip</code> is itself a
stateful computation. We’ve taken a bunch of stateful computations and
we’ve sort of glued them together. Hmm, sounds familiar.</p>
<p>The above code for <code>stackManip</code> is kind of tedious since
we’re manually giving the state to every stateful computation and
storing it and then giving it to the next one. Wouldn’t it be cooler if,
instead of giving the stack manually to each function, we could write
something like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>stackManip = do
    push 3
    a &lt;- pop
    pop</code></pre>
<p>Well, using the state monad will allow us to do exactly this. With
it, we will be able to take stateful computations like these and use
them without having to manage the state manually.</p>
<h3 id="the-state-monad">The State monad</h3>
<p>The <code>Control.Monad.State</code> module provides a
<code>newtype</code> that wraps stateful computations. Here’s its
definition:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype State s a = State { runState :: s -&gt; (a,s) }</code></pre>
<p>A <code>State s a</code> is a stateful computation that manipulates a
state of type <code>s</code> and has a result of type
<code>a</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen what stateful computations are about and how they
can even be thought of as values with contexts, let’s check out their
<code>Monad</code> instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monad (State s) where
    return x = State $ \s -&gt; (x,s)
    (State h) &gt;&gt;= f = State $ \s -&gt; let (a, newState) = h s
                                        (State g) = f a
                                    in  g newState</code></pre>
<p>Let’s take a gander at <code>return</code> first. Our aim with
<code>return</code> is to take a value and make a stateful computation
that always has that value as its result. That’s why we just make a
lambda <code>\s -&gt; (x,s)</code>. We always present <code>x</code> as
the result of the stateful computation and the state is kept unchanged,
because <code>return</code> has to put a value in a minimal context. So
<code>return</code> will make a stateful computation that presents a
certain value as the result and keeps the state unchanged.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/badge.png"
class="right" width="182" height="160" alt="im a cop" /></p>
<p>What about <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>? Well, the result of feeding a
stateful computation to a function with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> has to be
a stateful computation, right? So we start off with the
<code>State</code> <code>newtype</code> wrapper and then we type out a
lambda. This lambda will be our new stateful computation. But what goes
on in it? Well, we somehow have to extract the result value from the
first stateful computation. Because we’re in a stateful computation
right now, we can give the stateful computation <code>h</code> our
current state <code>s</code>, which results in a pair of result and a
new state: <code>(a, newState)</code>. Every time so far when we were
implementing <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, once we had the extracted the
result from the monadic value, we applied the function <code>f</code> to
it to get the new monadic value. In <code>Writer</code>, after doing
that and getting the new monadic value, we still had to make sure that
the context was taken care of by <code>mappend</code>ing the old monoid
value with the new one. Here, we do <code>f a</code> and we get a new
stateful computation <code>g</code>. Now that we have a new stateful
computation and a new state (goes by the name of <code>newState</code>)
we just apply that stateful computation <code>g</code> to the
<code>newState</code>. The result is a tuple of final result and final
state!</p>
<p>So with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, we kind of glue two stateful
computations together, only the second one is hidden inside a function
that takes the previous one’s result. Because <code>pop</code> and
<code>push</code> are already stateful computations, it’s easy to wrap
them into a <code>State</code> wrapper. Watch:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Control.Monad.State

pop :: State Stack Int
pop = State $ \(x:xs) -&gt; (x,xs)

push :: Int -&gt; State Stack ()
push a = State $ \xs -&gt; ((),a:xs)</code></pre>
<p><code>pop</code> is already a stateful computation and
<code>push</code> takes an <code>Int</code> and returns a stateful
computation. Now we can rewrite our previous example of pushing
<code>3</code> onto the stack and then popping two numbers off like
this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Control.Monad.State

stackManip :: State Stack Int
stackManip = do
    push 3
    a &lt;- pop
    pop</code></pre>
<p>See how we’ve glued a push and two pops into one stateful
computation? When we unwrap it from its <code>newtype</code> wrapper we
get a function to which we can provide some initial state:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; runState stackManip [5,8,2,1]
(5,[8,2,1])</code></pre>
<p>We didn’t have to bind the second <code>pop</code> to <code>a</code>
because we didn’t use that <code>a</code> at all. So we could have
written it like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>stackManip :: State Stack Int
stackManip = do
    push 3
    pop
    pop</code></pre>
<p>Pretty cool. But what if we want to do this: pop one number off the
stack and then if that number is <code>5</code> we just put it back onto
the stack and stop but if it isn’t <code>5</code>, we push
<code>3</code> and <code>8</code> back on? Well, here’s the code:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>stackStuff :: State Stack ()
stackStuff = do
    a &lt;- pop
    if a == 5
        then push 5
        else do
            push 3
            push 8</code></pre>
<p>This is quite straightforward. Let’s run it with an initial
stack.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; runState stackStuff [9,0,2,1,0]
((),[8,3,0,2,1,0])</code></pre>
<p>Remember, <code>do</code> expressions result in monadic values and
with the <code>State</code> monad, a single <code>do</code> expression
is also a stateful function. Because <code>stackManip</code> and
<code>stackStuff</code> are ordinary stateful computations, we can glue
them together to produce further stateful computations.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>moreStack :: State Stack ()
moreStack = do
    a &lt;- stackManip
    if a == 100
        then stackStuff
        else return ()</code></pre>
<p>If the result of <code>stackManip</code> on the current stack is
<code>100</code>, we run <code>stackStuff</code>, otherwise we do
nothing. <code>return ()</code> just keeps the state as it is and does
nothing.</p>
<p>The <code>Control.Monad.State</code> module provides a type class
that’s called <code>MonadState</code> and it features two pretty useful
functions, namely <code>get</code> and <code>put</code>. For
<code>State</code>, the <code>get</code> function is implemented like
this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>get = State $ \s -&gt; (s,s)</code></pre>
<p>So it just takes the current state and presents it as the result. The
<code>put</code> function takes some state and makes a stateful function
that replaces the current state with it:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>put newState = State $ \s -&gt; ((),newState)</code></pre>
<p>So with these, we can see what the current stack is or we can replace
it with a whole other stack. Like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>stackyStack :: State Stack ()
stackyStack = do
    stackNow &lt;- get
    if stackNow == [1,2,3]
        then put [8,3,1]
        else put [9,2,1]</code></pre>
<p>It’s worth examining what the type of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> would be
if it only worked for <code>State</code> values:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(&gt;&gt;=) :: State s a -&gt; (a -&gt; State s b) -&gt; State s b</code></pre>
<p>See how the type of the state <code>s</code> stays the same but the
type of the result can change from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>?
This means that we can glue together several stateful computations whose
results are of different types but the type of the state has to stay the
same. Now why is that? Well, for instance, for <code>Maybe</code>,
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> has this type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(&gt;&gt;=) :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b</code></pre>
<p>It makes sense that the monad itself, <code>Maybe</code>, doesn’t
change. It wouldn’t make sense to use <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> between two
different monads. Well, for the state monad, the monad is actually
<code>State s</code>, so if that <code>s</code> was different, we’d be
using <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> between two different monads.</p>
<h3 id="randomness-and-the-state-monad">Randomness and the state
monad</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this section, we saw how generating numbers can
sometimes be awkward because every random function takes a generator and
returns a random number along with a new generator, which must then be
used instead of the old one if we want to generate another random
number. The state monad makes dealing with this a lot easier.</p>
<p>The <code>random</code> function from <code>System.Random</code> has
the following type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>random :: (RandomGen g, Random a) =&gt; g -&gt; (a, g)</code></pre>
<p>Meaning it takes a random generator and produces a random number
along with a new generator. We can see that it’s a stateful computation,
so we can wrap it in the <code>State</code> <code>newtype</code>
constructor and then use it as a monadic value so that passing of the
state gets handled for us:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import System.Random
import Control.Monad.State

randomSt :: (RandomGen g, Random a) =&gt; State g a
randomSt = State random</code></pre>
<p>So now if we want to throw three coins (<code>True</code> is tails,
<code>False</code> is heads) we just do the following:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import System.Random
import Control.Monad.State

threeCoins :: State StdGen (Bool,Bool,Bool)
threeCoins = do
    a &lt;- randomSt
    b &lt;- randomSt
    c &lt;- randomSt
    return (a,b,c)</code></pre>
<p><code>threeCoins</code> is now a stateful computation and after
taking an initial random generator, it passes it to the first
<code>randomSt</code>, which produces a number and a new generator,
which gets passed to the next one and so on. We use
<code>return (a,b,c)</code> to present <code>(a,b,c)</code> as the
result without changing the most recent generator. Let’s give this a
go:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; runState threeCoins (mkStdGen 33)
((True,False,True),680029187 2103410263)</code></pre>
<p>Nice. Doing these sort of things that require some state to be kept
in between steps just became much less of a hassle!</p>
<h2 id="error">Error error on the wall</h2>
<p>We know by now that <code>Maybe</code> is used to add a context of
possible failure to values. A value can be a <code>Just something</code>
or a <code>Nothing</code>. However useful it may be, when we have a
<code>Nothing</code>, all we know is that there was some sort of
failure, but there’s no way to cram some more info in there telling us
what kind of failure it was or why it failed.</p>
<p>The <code>Either e a</code> type on the other hand, allows us to
incorporate a context of possible failure to our values while also being
able to attach values to the failure, so that they can describe what
went wrong or provide some other useful info regarding the failure. An
<code>Either e a</code> value can either be a <code>Right</code> value,
signifying the right answer and a success, or it can be a
<code>Left</code> value, signifying failure. For instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t Right 4
Right 4 :: (Num t) =&gt; Either a t
ghci&gt; :t Left &quot;out of cheese error&quot;
Left &quot;out of cheese error&quot; :: Either [Char] b</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty much just an enhanced <code>Maybe</code>, so it makes
sense for it to be a monad, because it can also be viewed as a value
with an added context of possible failure, only now there’s a value
attached when there’s an error as well.</p>
<p>Its <code>Monad</code> instance is similar to that of
<code>Maybe</code> and it can be found in
<code>Control.Monad.Error</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance (Error e) =&gt; Monad (Either e) where
    return x = Right x
    Right x &gt;&gt;= f = f x
    Left err &gt;&gt;= f = Left err
    fail msg = Left (strMsg msg)</code></pre>
<p><code>return</code>, as always, takes a value and puts it in a
default minimal context. It wraps our value in the <code>Right</code>
constructor because we’re using <code>Right</code> to represent a
successful computation where a result is present. This is a lot like
<code>return</code> for <code>Maybe</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> examines two possible cases: a
<code>Left</code> and a <code>Right</code>. In the case of a
<code>Right</code>, the function <code>f</code> is applied to the value
inside it, similar to how in the case of a <code>Just</code>, the
function is just applied to its contents. In the case of an error, the
<code>Left</code> value is kept, along with its contents, which describe
the failure.</p>
<p>The <code>Monad</code> instance for <code>Either e</code> makes an
additional requirement, and that is that the type of the value contained
in a <code>Left</code>, the one that’s indexed by the <code>e</code>
type parameter, has to be an instance of the <code>Error</code> type
class. The <code>Error</code> type class is for types whose values can
act like error messages. It defines the <code>strMsg</code> function,
which takes an error in the form of a string and returns such a value. A
good example of an <code>Error</code> instance is, well, the
<code>String</code> type! In the case of <code>String</code>, the
<code>strMsg</code> function just returns the string that it got:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t strMsg
strMsg :: (Error a) =&gt; String -&gt; a
ghci&gt; strMsg &quot;boom!&quot; :: String
&quot;boom!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>But since we usually use <code>String</code> to describe the error
when using <code>Either</code>, we don’t have to worry about this too
much. When a pattern match fails in <code>do</code> notation, a
<code>Left</code> value is used to signify this failure.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are a few examples of usage:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Left &quot;boom&quot; &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x+1)
Left &quot;boom&quot;
ghci&gt; Right 100 &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; Left &quot;no way!&quot;
Left &quot;no way!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>When we use <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed a <code>Left</code> value
to a function, the function is ignored and an identical
<code>Left</code> value is returned. When we feed a <code>Right</code>
value to a function, the function gets applied to what’s on the inside,
but in this case that function produced a <code>Left</code> value
anyway!</p>
<p>When we try to feed a <code>Right</code> value to a function that
also succeeds, we’re tripped up by a peculiar type error! Hmmm.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Right 3 &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x + 100)

&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    Ambiguous type variable `a&#39; in the constraints:
      `Error a&#39; arising from a use of `it&#39; at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-33
      `Show a&#39; arising from a use of `print&#39; at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-33
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)</code></pre>
<p>Haskell says that it doesn’t know which type to choose for the
<code>e</code> part of our <code>Either e a</code> typed value, even
though we’re just printing the <code>Right</code> part. This is due to
the <code>Error e</code> constraint on the <code>Monad</code> instance.
So if you get type errors like this one when using <code>Either</code>
as a monad, just add an explicit type signature:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Right 3 &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x + 100) :: Either String Int
Right 103</code></pre>
<p>Alright, now it works!</p>
<p>Other than this little hangup, using this monad is very similar to
using <code>Maybe</code> as a monad. In the previous chapter, we used
the monadic aspects of <code>Maybe</code> to simulate birds landing on
the balancing pole of a tightrope walker. As an exercise, you can
rewrite that with the error monad so that when the tightrope walker
slips and falls, we remember how many birds were on each side of the
pole when he fell.</p>
<h2 id="useful-monadic-functions">Some useful monadic functions</h2>
<p>In this section, we’re going to explore a few functions that either
operate on monadic values or return monadic values as their results (or
both!). Such functions are usually referred to as monadic functions.
While some of them will be brand new, others will be monadic
counterparts of functions that we already know, like <code>filter</code>
and <code>foldl</code>. Let’s see what they are then!</p>
<h3 id="liftm-and-friends">liftM and friends</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/wolf.png" class="right"
width="394" height="222" alt="im a cop too" /></p>
<p>When we started our journey to the top of Monad Mountain, we first
looked at functors, which are for things that can be mapped over. Then,
we learned about improved functors called applicative functors, which
allowed us to apply normal functions between several applicative values
as well as to take a normal value and put it in some default context.
Finally, we introduced monads as improved applicative functors, which
added the ability for these values with context to somehow be fed into
normal functions.</p>
<p>So every monad is an applicative functor and every applicative
functor is a functor. The <code>Applicative</code> type class has a
class constraint such that our type has to be an instance of
<code>Functor</code> before we can make it an instance of
<code>Applicative</code>. But even though <code>Monad</code> should have
the same constraint for <code>Applicative</code>, as every monad is an
applicative functor, it doesn’t, because the <code>Monad</code> type
class was introduced to Haskell way before <code>Applicative</code>.</p>
<p>But even though every monad is a functor, we don’t have to rely on it
having a <code>Functor</code> instance because of the <code>liftM</code>
function. <code>liftM</code> takes a function and a monadic value and
maps it over the monadic value. So it’s pretty much the same thing as
<code>fmap</code>! This is <code>liftM</code>’s type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>liftM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b</code></pre>
<p>And this is the type of <code>fmap</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>fmap :: (Functor f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code></pre>
<p>If the <code>Functor</code> and <code>Monad</code> instances for a
type obey the functor and monad laws, these two amount to the same thing
(and all the monads that we’ve met so far obey both). This is kind of
like <code>pure</code> and <code>return</code> do the same thing, only
one has an <code>Applicative</code> class constraint whereas the other
has a <code>Monad</code> one. Let’s try <code>liftM</code> out:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; liftM (*3) (Just 8)
Just 24
ghci&gt; fmap (*3) (Just 8)
Just 24
ghci&gt; runWriter $ liftM not $ Writer (True, &quot;chickpeas&quot;)
(False,&quot;chickpeas&quot;)
ghci&gt; runWriter $ fmap not $ Writer (True, &quot;chickpeas&quot;)
(False,&quot;chickpeas&quot;)
ghci&gt; runState (liftM (+100) pop) [1,2,3,4]
(101,[2,3,4])
ghci&gt; runState (fmap (+100) pop) [1,2,3,4]
(101,[2,3,4])</code></pre>
<p>We already know quite well how <code>fmap</code> works with
<code>Maybe</code> values. And <code>liftM</code> does the same thing.
For <code>Writer</code> values, the function is mapped over the first
component of the tuple, which is the result. Doing <code>fmap</code> or
<code>liftM</code> over a stateful computation results in another
stateful computation, only its eventual result is modified by the
supplied function. Had we not mapped <code>(+100)</code> over
<code>pop</code> in this case before running it, it would have returned
<code>(1,[2,3,4])</code>.</p>
<p>This is how <code>liftM</code> is implemented:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>liftM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
liftM f m = m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return (f x))</code></pre>
<p>Or with <code>do</code> notation:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>liftM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
liftM f m = do
    x &lt;- m
    return (f x)</code></pre>
<p>We feed the monadic value <code>m</code> into the function and then
we apply the function <code>f</code> to its result before putting it
back into a default context. Because of the monad laws, this is
guaranteed not to change the context, only the result that the monadic
value presents. We see that <code>liftM</code> is implemented without
referencing the <code>Functor</code> type class at all. This means that
we can implement <code>fmap</code> (or <code>liftM</code>, whatever you
want to call it) just by using the goodies that monads offer us. Because
of this, we can conclude that monads are stronger than just regular old
functors.</p>
<p>The <code>Applicative</code> type class allows us to apply functions
between values with contexts as if they were normal values. Like
this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (+) &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Just 5
Just 8
ghci&gt; (+) &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Using this applicative style makes things pretty easy.
<code>&lt;$&gt;</code> is just <code>fmap</code> and
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> is a function from the <code>Applicative</code>
type class that has the following type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(&lt;*&gt;) :: (Applicative f) =&gt; f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code></pre>
<p>So it’s kind of like <code>fmap</code>, only the function itself is
in a context. We have to somehow extract it from the context and map it
over the <code>f a</code> value and then assemble the context back
together. Because all functions are curried in Haskell by default, we
can use the combination of <code>&lt;$&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> to apply functions that take several parameters
between applicative values.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that just like <code>fmap</code>,
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> can also be implemented by using only what the
<code>Monad</code> type class give us. The <code>ap</code> function is
basically <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>, only it has a <code>Monad</code>
constraint instead of an <code>Applicative</code> one. Here’s its
definition:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ap :: (Monad m) =&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
ap mf m = do
    f &lt;- mf
    x &lt;- m
    return (f x)</code></pre>
<p><code>mf</code> is a monadic value whose result is a function.
Because the function is in a context as well as the value, we get the
function from the context and call it <code>f</code>, then get the value
and call that <code>x</code> and then finally apply the function to the
value and present that as a result. Here’s a quick demonstration:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just (+3) &lt;*&gt; Just 4
Just 7
ghci&gt; Just (+3) `ap` Just 4
Just 7
ghci&gt; [(+1),(+2),(+3)] &lt;*&gt; [10,11]
[11,12,12,13,13,14]
ghci&gt; [(+1),(+2),(+3)] `ap` [10,11]
[11,12,12,13,13,14]</code></pre>
<p>Now we see that monads are stronger than applicatives as well,
because we can use the functions from <code>Monad</code> to implement
the ones for <code>Applicative</code>. In fact, many times when a type
is found to be a monad, people first write up a <code>Monad</code>
instance and then make an <code>Applicative</code> instance by just
saying that <code>pure</code> is <code>return</code> and
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> is <code>ap</code>. Similarly, if you already
have a <code>Monad</code> instance for something, you can give it a
<code>Functor</code> instance just saying that <code>fmap</code> is
<code>liftM</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>liftA2</code> function is a convenience function for
applying a function between two applicative values. It’s defined simply
like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>liftA2 :: (Applicative f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c
liftA2 f x y = f &lt;$&gt; x &lt;*&gt; y</code></pre>
<p>The <code>liftM2</code> function does the same thing, only it has a
<code>Monad</code> constraint. There also exist <code>liftM3</code> and
<code>liftM4</code> and <code>liftM5</code>.</p>
<p>We saw how monads are stronger than applicatives and functors and how
even though all monads are functors and applicative functors, they don’t
necessarily have <code>Functor</code> and <code>Applicative</code>
instances, so we examined the monadic equivalents of the functions that
functors and applicative functors use.</p>
<h3 id="the-join-function">The join function</h3>
<p>Here’s some food for thought: if the result of one monadic value is
another monadic value i.e. if one monadic value is nested inside the
other, can you flatten them to just a single normal monadic value? Like,
if we have <code>Just (Just 9)</code>, can we make that into
<code>Just 9</code>? It turns out that any nested monadic value can be
flattened and that this is actually a property unique to monads. For
this, the <code>join</code> function exists. Its type is this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>join :: (Monad m) =&gt; m (m a) -&gt; m a</code></pre>
<p>So it takes a monadic value within a monadic value and gives us just
a monadic value, so it sort of flattens it. Here it is with some
<code>Maybe</code> values:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; join (Just (Just 9))
Just 9
ghci&gt; join (Just Nothing)
Nothing
ghci&gt; join Nothing
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>The first line has a successful computation as a result of a
successful computation, so they’re both just joined into one big
successful computation. The second line features a <code>Nothing</code>
as a result of a <code>Just</code> value. Whenever we were dealing with
<code>Maybe</code> values before and we wanted to combine several of
them into one, be it with <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> or
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, they all had to be <code>Just</code> values for
the result to be a <code>Just</code> value. If there was any failure
along the way, the result was a failure and the same thing happens here.
In the third line, we try to flatten what is from the onset a failure,
so the result is a failure as well.</p>
<p>Flattening lists is pretty intuitive:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; join [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, for lists, <code>join</code> is just
<code>concat</code>. To flatten a <code>Writer</code> value whose result
is a <code>Writer</code> value itself, we have to <code>mappend</code>
the monoid value.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; runWriter $ join (Writer (Writer (1,&quot;aaa&quot;),&quot;bbb&quot;))
(1,&quot;bbbaaa&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The outer monoid value <code>"bbb"</code> comes first and then to it
<code>"aaa"</code> is appended. Intuitively speaking, when you want to
examine what the result of a <code>Writer</code> value is, you have to
write its monoid value to the log first and only then can you examine
what it has inside.</p>
<p>Flattening <code>Either</code> values is very similar to flattening
<code>Maybe</code> values:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; join (Right (Right 9)) :: Either String Int
Right 9
ghci&gt; join (Right (Left &quot;error&quot;)) :: Either String Int
Left &quot;error&quot;
ghci&gt; join (Left &quot;error&quot;) :: Either String Int
Left &quot;error&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If we apply <code>join</code> to a stateful computation whose result
is a stateful computation, the result is a stateful computation that
first runs the outer stateful computation and then the resulting one.
Watch:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; runState (join (State $ \s -&gt; (push 10,1:2:s))) [0,0,0]
((),[10,1,2,0,0,0])</code></pre>
<p>The lambda here takes a state and puts <code>2</code> and
<code>1</code> onto the stack and presents <code>push 10</code> as its
result. So when this whole thing is flattened with <code>join</code> and
then run, it first puts <code>2</code> and <code>1</code> onto the stack
and then <code>push 10</code> gets carried out, pushing a
<code>10</code> on to the top.</p>
<p>The implementation for <code>join</code> is as follows:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>join :: (Monad m) =&gt; m (m a) -&gt; m a
join mm = do
    m &lt;- mm
    m</code></pre>
<p>Because the result of <code>mm</code> is a monadic value, we get that
result and then just put it on a line of its own because it’s a monadic
value. The trick here is that when we do <code>m &lt;- mm</code>, the
context of the monad in which we are in gets taken care of. That’s why,
for instance, <code>Maybe</code> values result in <code>Just</code>
values only if the outer and inner values are both <code>Just</code>
values. Here’s what this would look like if the <code>mm</code> value
was set in advance to <code>Just (Just 8)</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>joinedMaybes :: Maybe Int
joinedMaybes = do
    m &lt;- Just (Just 8)
    m</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/tipi.png" class="right"
width="253" height="379" alt="im a cop too as well also" /></p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about <code>join</code> is that
for every monad, feeding a monadic value to a function with
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is the same thing as just mapping that function
over the value and then using <code>join</code> to flatten the resulting
nested monadic value! In other words, <code>m &gt;&gt;= f</code> is
always the same thing as <code>join (fmap f m)</code>! It makes sense
when you think about it. With <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, we’re always
thinking about how to feed a monadic value to a function that takes a
normal value but returns a monadic value. If we just map that function
over the monadic value, we have a monadic value inside a monadic value.
For instance, say we have <code>Just 9</code> and the function
<code>\x -&gt; Just (x+1)</code>. If we map this function over
<code>Just 9</code>, we’re left with <code>Just (Just 10)</code>.</p>
<p>The fact that <code>m &gt;&gt;= f</code> always equals
<code>join (fmap f m)</code> is very useful if we’re making our own
<code>Monad</code> instance for some type because it’s often easier to
figure out how we would flatten a nested monadic value than figuring out
how to implement <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>.</p>
<h3 id="filterm">filterM</h3>
<p>The <code>filter</code> function is pretty much the bread of Haskell
programming (<code>map</code> being the butter). It takes a predicate
and a list to filter out and then returns a new list where only the
elements that satisfy the predicate are kept. Its type is this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code></pre>
<p>The predicate takes an element of the list and returns a
<code>Bool</code> value. Now, what if the <code>Bool</code> value that
it returned was actually a monadic value? Whoa! That is, what if it came
with a context? Could that work? For instance, what if every
<code>True</code> or a <code>False</code> value that the predicate
produced also had an accompanying monoid value, like
<code>["Accepted the number 5"]</code> or
<code>["3 is too small"]</code>? That sounds like it could work. If that
were the case, we’d expect the resulting list to also come with a log of
all the log values that were produced along the way. So if the
<code>Bool</code> that the predicate returned came with a context, we’d
expect the final resulting list to have some context attached as well,
otherwise the context that each <code>Bool</code> came with would be
lost.</p>
<p>The <code>filterM</code> function from <code>Control.Monad</code>
does just what we want! Its type is this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>filterM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; m Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; m [a]</code></pre>
<p>The predicate returns a monadic value whose result is a
<code>Bool</code>, but because it’s a monadic value, its context can be
anything from a possible failure to non-determinism and more! To ensure
that the context is reflected in the final result, the result is also a
monadic value.</p>
<p>Let’s take a list and only keep those values that are smaller than 4.
To start, we’ll just use the regular <code>filter</code> function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; filter (\x -&gt; x &lt; 4) [9,1,5,2,10,3]
[1,2,3]</code></pre>
<p>That’s pretty easy. Now, let’s make a predicate that, aside from
presenting a <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> result, also
provides a log of what it did. Of course, we’ll be using the
<code>Writer</code> monad for this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>keepSmall :: Int -&gt; Writer [String] Bool
keepSmall x
    | x &lt; 4 = do
        tell [&quot;Keeping &quot; ++ show x]
        return True
    | otherwise = do
        tell [show x ++ &quot; is too large, throwing it away&quot;]
        return False</code></pre>
<p>Instead of just and returning a <code>Bool</code>, this function
returns a <code>Writer [String] Bool</code>. It’s a monadic predicate.
Sounds fancy, doesn’t it? If the number is smaller than <code>4</code>
we report that we’re keeping it and then <code>return True</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s give it to <code>filterM</code> along with a list. Because
the predicate returns a <code>Writer</code> value, the resulting list
will also be a <code>Writer</code> value.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fst $ runWriter $ filterM keepSmall [9,1,5,2,10,3]
[1,2,3]</code></pre>
<p>Examining the result of the resulting <code>Writer</code> value, we
see that everything is in order. Now, let’s print the log and see what
we got:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn $ snd $ runWriter $ filterM keepSmall [9,1,5,2,10,3]
9 is too large, throwing it away
Keeping 1
5 is too large, throwing it away
Keeping 2
10 is too large, throwing it away
Keeping 3</code></pre>
<p>Awesome. So just by providing a monadic predicate to
<code>filterM</code>, we were able to filter a list while taking
advantage of the monadic context that we used.</p>
<p>A very cool Haskell trick is using <code>filterM</code> to get the
powerset of a list (if we think of them as sets for now). The powerset
of some set is a set of all subsets of that set. So if we have a set
like <code>[1,2,3]</code>, its powerset would include the following
sets:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>[1,2,3]
[1,2]
[1,3]
[1]
[2,3]
[2]
[3]
[]</code></pre>
<p>In other words, getting a powerset is like getting all the
combinations of keeping and throwing out elements from a set.
<code>[2,3]</code> is like the original set, only we excluded the number
<code>1</code>.</p>
<p>To make a function that returns a powerset of some list, we’re going
to rely on non-determinism. We take the list <code>[1,2,3]</code> and
then look at the first element, which is <code>1</code> and we ask
ourselves: should we keep it or drop it? Well, we’d like to do both
actually. So we are going to filter a list and we’ll use a predicate
that non-deterministically both keeps and drops every element from the
list. Here’s our <code>powerset</code> function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>powerset :: [a] -&gt; [[a]]
powerset xs = filterM (\x -&gt; [True, False]) xs</code></pre>
<p>Wait, that’s it? Yup. We choose to drop and keep every element,
regardless of what that element is. We have a non-deterministic
predicate, so the resulting list will also be a non-deterministic value
and will thus be a list of lists. Let’s give this a go:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; powerset [1,2,3]
[[1,2,3],[1,2],[1,3],[1],[2,3],[2],[3],[]]</code></pre>
<p>This takes a bit of thinking to wrap your head around, but if you
just consider lists as non-deterministic values that don’t know what to
be so they just decide to be everything at once, it’s a bit easier.</p>
<h3 id="foldm">foldM</h3>
<p>The monadic counterpart to <code>foldl</code> is <code>foldM</code>.
If you remember your folds from the <a
href="../higher-order-functions.html#folds">folds section</a>, you know
that <code>foldl</code> takes a binary function, a starting accumulator
and a list to fold up and then folds it from the left into a single
value by using the binary function. <code>foldM</code> does the same
thing, except it takes a binary function that produces a monadic value
and folds the list up with that. Unsurprisingly, the resulting value is
also monadic. The type of <code>foldl</code> is this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>foldl :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; [b] -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>Whereas <code>foldM</code> has the following type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>foldM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; m a) -&gt; a -&gt; [b] -&gt; m a</code></pre>
<p>The value that the binary function returns is monadic and so the
result of the whole fold is monadic as well. Let’s sum a list of numbers
with a fold:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; foldl (\acc x -&gt; acc + x) 0 [2,8,3,1]
14</code></pre>
<p>The starting accumulator is <code>0</code> and then <code>2</code>
gets added to the accumulator, resulting in a new accumulator that has a
value of <code>2</code>. <code>8</code> gets added to this accumulator
resulting in an accumulator of <code>10</code> and so on and when we
reach the end, the final accumulator is the result.</p>
<p>Now what if we wanted to sum a list of numbers but with the added
condition that if any number is greater than <code>9</code> in the list,
the whole thing fails? It would make sense to use a binary function that
checks if the current number is greater than <code>9</code> and if it
is, fails, and if it isn’t, continues on its merry way. Because of this
added possibility of failure, let’s make our binary function return a
<code>Maybe</code> accumulator instead of a normal one. Here’s the
binary function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>binSmalls :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Maybe Int
binSmalls acc x
    | x &gt; 9     = Nothing
    | otherwise = Just (acc + x)</code></pre>
<p>Because our binary function is now a monadic function, we can’t use
it with the normal <code>foldl</code>, but we have to use
<code>foldM</code>. Here goes:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; foldM binSmalls 0 [2,8,3,1]
Just 14
ghci&gt; foldM binSmalls 0 [2,11,3,1]
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Excellent! Because one number in the list was greater than
<code>9</code>, the whole thing resulted in a <code>Nothing</code>.
Folding with a binary function that returns a <code>Writer</code> value
is cool as well because then you log whatever you want as your fold goes
along its way.</p>
<h3 id="making-a-safe-rpn-calculator">Making a safe RPN calculator</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/miner.png" class="left"
width="280" height="396" alt="i’ve found yellow!" /></p>
<p>When we were solving the problem of <a
href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/reverse-polish-notation-calculator">implementing
a RPN calculator</a>, we noted that it worked fine as long as the input
that it got made sense. But if something went wrong, it caused our whole
program to crash. Now that we know how to take some code that we have
and make it monadic, let’s take our RPN calculator and add error
handling to it by taking advantage of the <code>Maybe</code> monad.</p>
<p>We implemented our RPN calculator by taking a string like
<code>"1 3 + 2 *"</code>, breaking it up into words to get something
like <code>["1","3","+","2","*"]</code> and then folding over that list
by starting out with an empty stack and then using a binary folding
function that adds numbers to the stack or manipulates numbers on the
top of the stack to add them together and divide them and such.</p>
<p>This was the main body of our function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.List

solveRPN :: String -&gt; Double
solveRPN = head . foldl foldingFunction [] . words</code></pre>
<p>We made the expression into a list of strings, folded over it with
our folding function and then when we were left with just one item in
the stack, we returned that item as the answer. This was the folding
function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>foldingFunction :: [Double] -&gt; String -&gt; [Double]
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;*&quot; = (x * y):ys
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;+&quot; = (x + y):ys
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;-&quot; = (y - x):ys
foldingFunction xs numberString = read numberString:xs</code></pre>
<p>The accumulator of the fold was a stack, which we represented with a
list of <code>Double</code> values. As the folding function went over
the RPN expression, if the current item was an operator, it took two
items off the top of the stack, applied the operator between them and
then put the result back on the stack. If the current item was a string
that represented a number, it converted that string into an actual
number and returned a new stack that was like the old one, except with
that number pushed to the top.</p>
<p>Let’s first make our folding function capable of graceful failure.
Its type is going to change from what it is now to this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>foldingFunction :: [Double] -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe [Double]</code></pre>
<p>So it will either return <code>Just</code> a new stack or it will
fail with <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>reads</code> function is like <code>read</code>, only it
returns a list with a single element in case of a successful read. If it
fails to read something, then it returns an empty list. Apart from
returning the value that it read, it also returns the part of the string
that it didn’t consume. We’re going to say that it always has to consume
the full input to work and make it into a <code>readMaybe</code>
function for convenience. Here it is:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>readMaybe :: (Read a) =&gt; String -&gt; Maybe a
readMaybe st = case reads st of [(x,&quot;&quot;)] -&gt; Just x
                                _ -&gt; Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Testing it out:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; readMaybe &quot;1&quot; :: Maybe Int
Just 1
ghci&gt; readMaybe &quot;GO TO HELL&quot; :: Maybe Int
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Okay, it seems to work. So, let’s make our folding function into a
monadic function that can fail:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>foldingFunction :: [Double] -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe [Double]
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;*&quot; = return ((x * y):ys)
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;+&quot; = return ((x + y):ys)
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;-&quot; = return ((y - x):ys)
foldingFunction xs numberString = liftM (:xs) (readMaybe numberString)</code></pre>
<p>The first three cases are like the old ones, except the new stack
gets wrapped in a <code>Just</code> (we used <code>return</code> here to
do this, but we could have written <code>Just</code> just as well). In
the last case, we do <code>readMaybe numberString</code> and then we map
<code>(:xs)</code> over it. So if the stack <code>xs</code> is
<code>[1.0,2.0]</code> and <code>readMaybe numberString</code> results
in a <code>Just 3.0</code>, the result is
<code>Just [3.0,1.0,2.0]</code>. If <code>readMaybe numberString</code>
results in a <code>Nothing</code> then the result is
<code>Nothing</code>. Let’s try out the folding function by itself:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; foldingFunction [3,2] &quot;*&quot;
Just [6.0]
ghci&gt; foldingFunction [3,2] &quot;-&quot;
Just [-1.0]
ghci&gt; foldingFunction [] &quot;*&quot;
Nothing
ghci&gt; foldingFunction [] &quot;1&quot;
Just [1.0]
ghci&gt; foldingFunction [] &quot;1 wawawawa&quot;
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>It looks like it’s working! And now it’s time for the new and
improved <code>solveRPN</code>. Here it is ladies and gents!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.List

solveRPN :: String -&gt; Maybe Double
solveRPN st = do
    [result] &lt;- foldM foldingFunction [] (words st)
    return result</code></pre>
<p>Just like before, we take the string and make it into a list of
words. Then, we do a fold, starting with the empty stack, only instead
of doing a normal <code>foldl</code>, we do a <code>foldM</code>. The
result of that <code>foldM</code> should be a <code>Maybe</code> value
that contains a list (that’s our final stack) and that list should have
only one value. We use a <code>do</code> expression to get that value
and we call it <code>result</code>. In case the <code>foldM</code>
returns a <code>Nothing</code>, the whole thing will be a
<code>Nothing</code>, because that’s how <code>Maybe</code> works. Also
notice that we pattern match in the <code>do</code> expression, so if
the list has more than one value or none at all, the pattern match fails
and a <code>Nothing</code> is produced. In the last line we just do
<code>return result</code> to present the result of the RPN calculation
as the result of the final <code>Maybe</code> value.</p>
<p>Let’s give it a shot:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;1 2 * 4 +&quot;
Just 6.0
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;1 2 * 4 + 5 *&quot;
Just 30.0
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;1 2 * 4&quot;
Nothing
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;1 8 wharglbllargh&quot;
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>The first failure happens because the final stack isn’t a list with
one element in it and so the pattern matching in the <code>do</code>
expression fails. The second failure happens because
<code>readMaybe</code> returns a <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<h3 id="composing-monadic-functions">Composing monadic functions</h3>
<p>When we were learning about the monad laws, we said that the
<code>&lt;=&lt;</code> function is just like composition, only instead
of working for normal functions like <code>a -&gt; b</code>, it works
for monadic functions like <code>a -&gt; m b</code>. For instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let f = (+1) . (*100)
ghci&gt; f 4
401
ghci&gt; let g = (\x -&gt; return (x+1)) &lt;=&lt; (\x -&gt; return (x*100))
ghci&gt; Just 4 &gt;&gt;= g
Just 401</code></pre>
<p>In this example we first composed two normal functions, applied the
resulting function to <code>4</code> and then we composed two monadic
functions and fed <code>Just 4</code> to the resulting function with
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>.</p>
<p>If we have a bunch of functions in a list, we can compose them one
all into one big function by just using <code>id</code> as the starting
accumulator and the <code>.</code> function as the binary function.
Here’s an example:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let f = foldr (.) id [(+1),(*100),(+1)]
ghci&gt; f 1
201</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>f</code> takes a number and then adds
<code>1</code> to it, multiplies the result by <code>100</code> and then
adds <code>1</code> to that. Anyway, we can compose monadic functions in
the same way, only instead normal composition we use
<code>&lt;=&lt;</code> and instead of <code>id</code> we use
<code>return</code>. We don’t have to use a <code>foldM</code> over a
<code>foldr</code> or anything because the <code>&lt;=&lt;</code>
function makes sure that composition happens in a monadic fashion.</p>
<p>When we were getting to know the list monad in the <a
href="a-fistful-of-monads.html#the-list-monad">previous chapter</a>, we
used it to figure out if a knight can go from one position on a
chessboard to another in exactly three moves. We had a function called
<code>moveKnight</code> which took the knight’s position on the board
and returned all the possible moves that he can make next. Then, to
generate all the possible positions that he can have after taking three
moves, we made the following function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>in3 start = return start &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight</code></pre>
<p>And to check if he can go from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code>
in three moves, we did the following:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>canReachIn3 :: KnightPos -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; Bool
canReachIn3 start end = end `elem` in3 start</code></pre>
<p>Using monadic function composition, we can make a function like
<code>in3</code>, only instead of generating all the positions that the
knight can have after making three moves, we can do it for an arbitrary
number of moves. If you look at <code>in3</code>, we see that we used
<code>moveKnight</code> three times and each time we used
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed it all the possible previous positions.
So now, let’s make it more general. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.List

inMany :: Int -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
inMany x start = return start &gt;&gt;= foldr (&lt;=&lt;) return (replicate x moveKnight)</code></pre>
<p>First we use <code>replicate</code> to make a list that contains
<code>x</code> copies of the function <code>moveKnight</code>. Then, we
monadically compose all those functions into one, which gives us a
function that takes a starting position and non-deterministically moves
the knight <code>x</code> times. Then, we just make the starting
position into a singleton list with <code>return</code> and feed it to
the function.</p>
<p>Now, we can change our <code>canReachIn3</code> function to be more
general as well:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>canReachIn :: Int -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; Bool
canReachIn x start end = end `elem` inMany x start</code></pre>
<h2 id="making-monads">Making monads</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/spearhead.png"
class="center" width="780" height="244" alt="kewl" /></p>
<p>In this section, we’re going to look at an example of how a type gets
made, identified as a monad and then given the appropriate
<code>Monad</code> instance. We don’t usually set out to make a monad
with the sole purpose of making a monad. Instead, we usually make a type
that whose purpose is to model an aspect of some problem and then later
on if we see that the type represents a value with a context and can act
like a monad, we give it a <code>Monad</code> instance.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, lists are used to represent non-deterministic values.
A list like <code>[3,5,9]</code> can be viewed as a single
non-deterministic value that just can’t decide what it’s going to be.
When we feed a list into a function with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, it just
makes all the possible choices of taking an element from the list and
applying the function to it and then presents those results in a list as
well.</p>
<p>If we look at the list <code>[3,5,9]</code> as the numbers
<code>3</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>9</code> occurring at once, we
might notice that there’s no info regarding the probability that each of
those numbers occurs. What if we wanted to model a non-deterministic
value like <code>[3,5,9]</code>, but we wanted to express that
<code>3</code> has a 50% chance of happening and <code>5</code> and
<code>9</code> both have a 25% chance of happening? Let’s try and make
this happen!</p>
<p>Let’s say that every item in the list comes with another value, a
probability of it happening. It might make sense to present this like
this then:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>[(3,0.5),(5,0.25),(9,0.25)]</code></pre>
<p>In mathematics, probabilities aren’t usually expressed in
percentages, but rather in real numbers between a 0 and 1. A 0 means
that there’s no chance in hell for something to happen and a 1 means
that it’s happening for sure. Floating point numbers can get real messy
real fast because they tend to lose precision, so Haskell offers us a
data type for rational numbers that doesn’t lose precision. That type is
called <code>Rational</code> and it lives in <code>Data.Ratio</code>. To
make a <code>Rational</code>, we write it as if it were a fraction. The
numerator and the denominator are separated by a <code>%</code>. Here
are a few examples:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; 1%4
1 % 4
ghci&gt; 1%2 + 1%2
1 % 1
ghci&gt; 1%3 + 5%4
19 % 12</code></pre>
<p>The first line is just one quarter. In the second line we add two
halves to get a whole and in the third line we add one third with five
quarters and get nineteen twelfths. So let’use throw out our floating
points and use <code>Rational</code> for our probabilities:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [(3,1%2),(5,1%4),(9,1%4)]
[(3,1 % 2),(5,1 % 4),(9,1 % 4)]</code></pre>
<p>Okay, so <code>3</code> has a one out of two chance of happening
while <code>5</code> and <code>9</code> will happen one time out of
four. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>We took lists and we added some extra context to them, so this
represents values with contexts too. Before we go any further, let’s
wrap this into a <code>newtype</code> because something tells me we’ll
be making some instances.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.Ratio

newtype Prob a = Prob { getProb :: [(a,Rational)] } deriving Show</code></pre>
<p>Alright. Is this a functor? Well, the list is a functor, so this
should probably be a functor as well, because we just added some stuff
to the list. When we map a function over a list, we apply it to each
element. Here, we’ll apply it to each element as well, only we’ll leave
the probabilities as they are. Let’s make an instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor Prob where
    fmap f (Prob xs) = Prob $ map (\(x,p) -&gt; (f x,p)) xs</code></pre>
<p>We unwrap it from the <code>newtype</code> with pattern matching,
apply the function <code>f</code> to the values while keeping the
probabilities as they are and then wrap it back up. Let’s see if it
works:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fmap negate (Prob [(3,1%2),(5,1%4),(9,1%4)])
Prob {getProb = [(-3,1 % 2),(-5,1 % 4),(-9,1 % 4)]}</code></pre>
<p>Another thing to note is that the probabilities should always add up
to <code>1</code>. If those are all the things that can happen, it
doesn’t make sense for the sum of their probabilities to be anything
other than <code>1</code>. A coin that lands tails 75% of the time and
heads 50% of the time seems like it could only work in some other
strange universe.</p>
<p>Now the big question, is this a monad? Given how the list is a monad,
this looks like it should be a monad as well. First, let’s think about
<code>return</code>. How does it work for lists? It takes a value and
puts it in a singleton list. What about here? Well, since it’s supposed
to be a default minimal context, it should also make a singleton list.
What about the probability? Well, <code>return x</code> is supposed to
make a monadic value that always presents <code>x</code> as its result,
so it doesn’t make sense for the probability to be <code>0</code>. If it
always has to present it as its result, the probability should be
<code>1</code>!</p>
<p>What about <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>? Seems kind of tricky, so let’s
make use of the fact that <code>m &gt;&gt;= f</code> always equals
<code>join (fmap f m)</code> for monads and think about how we would
flatten a probability list of probability lists. As an example, let’s
consider this list where there’s a 25% chance that exactly one of
<code>'a'</code> or <code>'b'</code> will happen. Both <code>'a'</code>
and <code>'b'</code> are equally likely to occur. Also, there’s a 75%
chance that exactly one of <code>'c'</code> or <code>'d'</code> will
happen. <code>'c'</code> and <code>'d'</code> are also equally likely to
happen. Here’s a picture of a probability list that models this
scenario:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/prob.png" class="left"
width="456" height="142" alt="probs" /></p>
<p>What are the chances for each of these letters to occur? If we were
to draw this as just four boxes, each with a probability, what would
those probabilities be? To find out, all we have to do is multiply each
probability with all of probabilities that it contains. <code>'a'</code>
would occur one time out of eight, as would <code>'b'</code>, because if
we multiply one half by one quarter we get one eighth. <code>'c'</code>
would happen three times out of eight because three quarters multiplied
by one half is three eighths. <code>'d'</code> would also happen three
times out of eight. If we sum all the probabilities, they still add up
to one.</p>
<p>Here’s this situation expressed as a probability list:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>thisSituation :: Prob (Prob Char)
thisSituation = Prob
    [( Prob [(&#39;a&#39;,1%2),(&#39;b&#39;,1%2)] , 1%4 )
    ,( Prob [(&#39;c&#39;,1%2),(&#39;d&#39;,1%2)] , 3%4)
    ]</code></pre>
<p>Notice that its type is <code>Prob (Prob Char)</code>. So now that
we’ve figure out how to flatten a nested probability list, all we have
to do is write the code for this and then we can write
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> simply as <code>join (fmap f m)</code> and we
have ourselves a monad! So here’s <code>flatten</code>, which we’ll use
because the name <code>join</code> is already taken:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>flatten :: Prob (Prob a) -&gt; Prob a
flatten (Prob xs) = Prob $ concat $ map multAll xs
    where multAll (Prob innerxs,p) = map (\(x,r) -&gt; (x,p*r)) innerxs</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>multAll</code> takes a tuple of probability list
and a probability <code>p</code> that comes with it and then multiplies
every inner probability with <code>p</code>, returning a list of pairs
of items and probabilities. We map <code>multAll</code> over each pair
in our nested probability list and then we just flatten the resulting
nested list.</p>
<p>Now we have all that we need, we can write a <code>Monad</code>
instance!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monad Prob where
    return x = Prob [(x,1%1)]
    m &gt;&gt;= f = flatten (fmap f m)
    fail _ = Prob []</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/ride.png" class="right"
width="177" height="406" alt="ride em cowboy" /></p>
<p>Because we already did all the hard work, the instance is very
simple. We also defined the <code>fail</code> function, which is the
same as it is for lists, so if there’s a pattern match failure in a
<code>do</code> expression, a failure occurs within the context of a
probability list.</p>
<p>It’s also important to check if the monad laws hold for the monad
that we just made. The first one says that
<code>return x &gt;&gt;= f</code> should be equal to <code>f x</code>. A
rigorous proof would be rather tedious, but we can see that if we put a
value in a default context with <code>return</code> and then
<code>fmap</code> a function over that and flatten the resulting
probability list, every probability that results from the function would
be multiplied by the <code>1%1</code> probability that we made with
<code>return</code>, so it wouldn’t affect the context. The reasoning
for <code>m &gt;&gt;= return</code> being equal to just <code>m</code>
is similar. The third law states that
<code>f &lt;=&lt; (g &lt;=&lt; h)</code> should be the same as
<code>(f &lt;=&lt; g) &lt;=&lt; h</code>. This one holds as well,
because it holds for the list monad which forms the basis of the
probability monad and because multiplication is associative.
<code>1%2 * (1%3 * 1%5)</code> is equal to
<code>(1%2 * 1%3) * 1%5</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a monad, what can we do with it? Well, it can help
us do calculations with probabilities. We can treat probabilistic events
as values with contexts and the probability monad will make sure that
those probabilities get reflected in the probabilities of the final
result.</p>
<p>Say we have two normal coins and one loaded coin that gets tails an
astounding nine times out of ten and heads only one time out of ten. If
we throw all the coins at once, what are the odds of all of them landing
tails? First, let’s make probability values for a normal coin flip and
for a loaded one:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Coin = Heads | Tails deriving (Show, Eq)

coin :: Prob Coin
coin = Prob [(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)]

loadedCoin :: Prob Coin
loadedCoin = Prob [(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)]</code></pre>
<p>And finally, the coin throwing action:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.List (all)

flipThree :: Prob Bool
flipThree = do
    a &lt;- coin
    b &lt;- coin
    c &lt;- loadedCoin
    return (all (==Tails) [a,b,c])</code></pre>
<p>Giving it a go, we see that the odds of all three landing tails are
not that good, despite cheating with our loaded coin:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getProb flipThree
[(False,1 % 40),(False,9 % 40),(False,1 % 40),(False,9 % 40),
 (False,1 % 40),(False,9 % 40),(False,1 % 40),(True,9 % 40)]</code></pre>
<p>All three of them will land tails nine times out of forty, which is
less than 25%. We see that our monad doesn’t know how to join all of the
<code>False</code> outcomes where all coins don’t land tails into one
outcome. That’s not a big problem, since writing a function to put all
the same outcomes into one outcome is pretty easy and is left as an
exercise to the reader (you!)</p>
<p>In this section, we went from having a question (what if lists also
carried information about probability?) to making a type, recognizing a
monad and finally making an instance and doing something with it. I
think that’s quite fetching! By now, we should have a pretty good grasp
on monads and what they’re about.</p>
